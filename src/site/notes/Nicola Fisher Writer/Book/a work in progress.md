## a work in progress

[This](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpvTI8zo_Kg/?igshid=YmRhY2Q4MGU=) by Huma Qureshi inspired me to think differently about book writing. I've tried different ways. I have a ton of notes in Obsidian. They're all fragmented and disjointed. Their volume and lack of coherence overwhelm me so they get parked and left.

So, here we are again. Starting over.
