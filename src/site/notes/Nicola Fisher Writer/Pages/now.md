## now

What I'm doing now ... 

## the tiny project

This is what I'm *supposed to be* working on in 2023. A tiny project involving tiny blogs, podcasts and videos. The plan is to get more done by creating smaller things.

> “The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard. There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed. Most people die with everything still inside of them. The way to live is to create. Die empty. Get every idea out of your head and into reality. Calling yourself creative doesn’t make it true. Make finishing your top priority.”

## the tiny project progress

March has not, so far, proved to be a much better month. I'm still working long hours as well as driving Chris to events and demos. Not only am I spinning lots of plates, it feels as though my mojo has gone too.

I'm at that place I've been before when I'm tempted to burn everything down. I haven't written anything for weeks, if not months. I have no ideas in my head. I haven't posted on Substack for some time. I've written one post recently on Medium. 

I've pared back some more on my plans. I made things far too complicated in January. 

Substack: I really like this platform but it's not working for me at all right now.
Medium: I make a small monthly income despite not writing anything much at all. It covers my monthly subscription and buys me a coffee or two.
Podcasts: all deleted. The plan - some day - is to record on Substack.

## work

Still very busy and lots to do but the 12 month plan is being implemented, two new staff have joined which is helping. I've taken on a new project so am at full capacity.

## social media

Still out of love with social media. I have, however, signed up for a new Twitter account as there's lots of action on there re Twos. I don't know how long this will last.

## twos

Still loving [Twos](https://www.TwosApp.com?code=nicola). It's an incredible to do list app, reminder app, note taking app and list app. I like the mix. The lists manage my projects and keep me on track. Twos World let's me share public lists and see other people's lists. It's a brilliant tool. 

On a weekly basis I find more ways to use Twos. I create new lists and add content all the time. It really does help me get more done.

## personal

I've realised that I've reached rock bottom ... again! I've put my all into work, other projects (not mine) and there's nothing left. I'm depleted and not refilling the well. I do this on a regular basis. I still haven't learned to recognise the signs. I'm making small inroads into addressing this.
