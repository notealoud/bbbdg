## writing with abundance and PKM

I recently joined a webinar with David Perell, a precursor to his online course [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/). In just one hour I came away with some game changing ideas.

The main one was _write with abundance_. Tying in perfectly with the whole knowledge management theme, Obsidian and the various tools I'm currently using, the premise of writing with abundance is to use the ideas you read about as a launchpad for your own articles. So, rather than be facing the blank page or screen when you write, you start from a place of already having points to ponder.
