## welcome back to the podcast

Talking about why I migrated my blog and newsletter to Ghost. How Obsidian, my favourite note taking app, fits in.

Our filming projects this year. Blind Ambition plus, shhhh, the one I can't talk about yet.

Our days away at Biggin Hall, spending time with my inspiration, Annie, and her friend, Jenny.
