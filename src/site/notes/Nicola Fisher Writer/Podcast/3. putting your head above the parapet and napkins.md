## putting your head above the parapet

The issue of Derbyshire Life featuring the interview with Chris was in the shops last weekend. I talk about how we have raised Chris' profile and how he has learned to put his head above the parapet.

Bamber had fun this week at a doggy playground where he spent much of the time eating grass!

I've been busy with new clients and am loving seeing potential and opportunity for the small businesses I support.

I'm now, officially, a private Beta tester for [Napkin](https://www.napkin.one/). Hooray!
