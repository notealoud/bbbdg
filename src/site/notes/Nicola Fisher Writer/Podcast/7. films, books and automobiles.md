## films, books and automobiles

A catch up with a tour of Scotland, and the release of a short film about Chris.

Talking about my exploration of Notion for writing my [[Ship 30 for 30\|Ship 30 for 30]] essays, and planning my week. Plus, how I've reorganised Obsidian for publishing my website.

And the very lush book that is A Cook's Book by Nigel Slater.
