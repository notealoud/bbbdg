## my life in france: julia child

[My Life in France: The Life Story of Julia Child](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07H2N1CLB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0)

I've only just started reading this book by Julia Child.

Recently I watched Julie and Julia again. Then a friend mentioned the new series, Julia, and the book, My Life in France.

I started reading the book and haven't been able to put it down. While Julia's life in Paris pre-dates my own by about 30 years, I recognise so much of what she mentions. Her love of France and all things French mirrors my own.

The book falls into the category of unputdownable. I find myself immersed in her life and memories of my own time there.

Although I'm not passionate about cooking, I enjoy Julia's journey as a chef. Her descriptions of memorable meals whet my appetite. 

Somehow, we are there with her, in Paris, in France and even in England. This book is part autobiography, part personal diary, and why I'm finding it such compelling reading.
