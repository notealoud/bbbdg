## 10 things I believe about life

1. Nothing happens by chance. Our journey through life has definition, and we each have a role to play in our own lives and the lives of others.

2. Life is much more than what we do for a living.

3. Our lives follow patterns with common milestones that we all encounter. Our individual paths might be different but there are always shared experiences.

4. We are here for a reason, something far greater than just passing through and existing. We could have one pivotal moment that eclipses everything or a series of moments that give our life meaning.

5. We are here to experience life fully. To discover what bring us joy. We are here to learn how to do that.

6. Our purpose may change and evolve over time. We find our purpose by being who we truly are. Or, our purpose finds us when we're living our truth.

7. We each have a gift that we bring to the world. What that something is varies for each of us. It’s that dream. It’s almost intangible. It’s the carrot dangling just out of our reach. It's how we change the world.

8. It's better to stand out than fit in. Walking the road less travelled is the most life enhancing route.

9. Talk to the people no-one else wants to talk to. Seek out those who are different, and on the periphery. Their stories will most likely fascinate you.

10. Say what is usually unspoken. Don't dodge the big topics. Sometimes a double-edged sword! Face life head on.
