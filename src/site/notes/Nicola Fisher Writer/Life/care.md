Here in the UK the NHS seems to have gone to the dogs. More and more often I read posts stating that the NHS is done for. In the work I do, it seems to be the case.

Sick people are being released from hospital prematurely. Without the necessary support, some going home to cold, unheated houses with no food. Others being condemned to a life of living alone, and housebound. People are being neglected.

But there is no-one to help them.

Aside from my esoteric interests and belief that we are at a global pivotal moment where change is coming at us at break neck speed, what does this type of care say about us as a community?

We have all become so insular. Those without the benefit of families have no-one. The care services are over worked and underpaid. Recruiting care staff is challenging. There are not enough carers. The government won't do what is needed to ensure that all human beings are treated with dignity and can live independent lives for as long as they are able.

Yet, the government will spend millions in not billions on weapons and making sure that rail companies are subsidised when their staff go on strike.

There is huge imbalance.
