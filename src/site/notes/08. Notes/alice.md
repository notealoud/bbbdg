19 November 1973 - Monday

Alice’s feet squelched in her flat black work shoes. They were ugly but at least her feet didn’t ache even though they were soaked now. She leaned against the door until it closed, eased her feet out of the sodden leather and looked down at the mat. 

With her free hand she picked up the mail, still slightly damp - it had been raining most of the day - and took the small pile of envelopes, her coat and work bag into the kitchen. She dumped the lot on the work top, and flicked the switch on the kettle. Coffee first.

She glanced idly at the three letters. And then it felt as though she had stopped breathing. No! It couldn’t be. 

She ripped open one of the letters. Not now!

Alice knew how this would unfold. Most people didn’t. There were rumours, admittedly, but the process was a closely guarded secret. It was only because of the nature of her job that Alice had come across this before.

But she had never seen an actual death certificate notification.

You were always given 48 hours notice. Alice wasn’t sure if this was a good or bad thing. Was ignorance bliss or was it better to know?

She slumped on the sofa. Coffee forgotten. 

She exhaled. 

Then, for a moment, she felt relief as she contemplated her life. She hated her job so she could kick that to the wall now. She was almost out of money. Each month was a challenge. Life had become hard work. Alice couldn’t remember the last time she had laughed. When had she done something just for fun? 

Maybe this was a good way out. No-one would miss her. She was still single. Her parents were dead. Since they had gone, she had lost any sense of home and it felt as though life as she had known it was over. Alice had never found her way since. Her life had ceased to provide her with any joy. Would it be that much of a hardship to check out now?

That evening Alice had no appetite. What do you do when the clock is ticking? Eventually she went to bed. She slept fitfully. She woke around 5 a.m. but didn't get up. There was no point. She stayed in bed, laid low, almost unable to move. It was nearly 11:00 when, parched and needing the loo, she finally had no option.

She made it down to the kitchen and brewed herself a coffee. Usually her favourite drink, today it gave her no pleasure. Alice sat at the kitchen table. Her head was in a fog. Maybe if she stayed at home, she would be OK. But even as she had that thought, she knew it would make no difference. Others had attempted that only for a lorry to crash into their front room. 

Another couple of hours ticked by. Alice slumped, still wearing yesterday's clothes that she had also slept in. Another coffee. 

She looked at the clock. This was crazy.

What have I got to lose? I'm going to die anyway. What's the point in mopsing about at home. What do I want to do? What have I always wanted to do?

With a renewed sense of urgency, Alice showered, changed and then packed an overnight bag. 

She left her will on the kitchen table - leaving everything to the local animal sanctuary.

Alice ordered a taxi. While she waited for it to arrive, she looked around the house for the last time. 

Finally the taxi arrived, and took Alice to the station. She made the train just in time. Less than two hours later she was in London, and settling into the most expensive hotel she could find. And, thanks to the savvy Concierge, with a dinner reservation at a restaurant of her dreams. 

Before dinner, Alice went out to a nearby chemist and bought a pair of scissors and some hair dye.

She wasn't planning on sleeping tonight. As people said, she could sleep when she was dead. She cut her hair, badly. And added the dye to her already damp hair. Thirty minutes and half a bottle of wine later, it was done. She rinsed out the dye and roughly dried her now short hair.

Alice felt rebellious and more like herself than she had in years. Why was it now that she finally had this realisation? She took a deep breath to calm herself and the building frenzy because of all those wasted years. It was too late now. She only had this moment. 

She drank from the bottle of wine to fortify herself. But not too much. She needed to think straight and carry out her plan. 

She wanted to do something racy. She walked across Soho and found an open tattoo shop. Alice wanted to die with a small tattoo on her skin. A mark that she had been here, that she had lived, a little at least. Some small evidence that she was a quiet rebel. She wasn't going to choose something twee like a dolphin or a heart. She pulled a letter from her bag. Written by her Mother and finished, as always, with a small line drawing of a flower. That would be her tattoo.

She emerged from the tattoo studio with her skin tingling and her heart soaring. She admired her own bravery. She felt a little badass.

Dinner was all she had hoped it might be but ... she didn't have the time or patience to enjoy it. She wondered how those death row inmates felt eating their last meal.

Next door was a casino. Full of Chinese from the nearby China Town, men out for a late night, she bought a stack of chips with no clue as to what she was doing. She sat at the roulette table, trying to look as though she did this every night of the week when in fact it was the first time ever.

She put a chip on black. Beginner's luck, it came up. The croupier pushed a pile of chips towards her. She put a handful of chips on red. She won a small pile. She carried on playing, winning a bit, losing some. But generally maintaining a bigger pile that she had started with. 

And then, she thought, what the heck? She put it all on black. All or nothing. And she won. 

She cashed in her chips. She stuffed the cash in her bag. And headed towards Leicester Square. It was late now. But still people milled about. 

People going nowhere. Just drinking, eating, and larking about. 

Alice didn't want to be around people, not strangers anyway. She walked slowly along the Thames, bought a coffee from a late night cafe and sat on a bench watching passers by as the lights shimmered on the water. 

She couldn't fit an entire life time into one night. Neither did she want to, Alice realised. Somehow none of it mattered any more.

On the way back to the hotel, she pulled her casino winnings from her bag. A homeless man slept near Embankment in a cardboard construction. Alice tucked the cash inside his coat and hoped he would find it in the morning.

21 November 1973

Alice sat on the balcony wearing one of those soft hotel robes. She'd ordered room service. It felt very decadent. Looking out on to Whitehall, she drank the best coffee she had ever tasted, and ate a continental breakfast. 

Mid morning, Alice paid her bill and checked out. In her pocket was her purse with a few notes. Also inside, folded over several times was the death certificate notice to make identification easy. She left everything else in her hotel room.

She still had a few hour to kill. Remembering feeding the birds as a child, Alice walked to St James' Park. She found a spot where an old man was holding seed in the palm of his hand. Birds flew over, fed and then flew away again. 

Alice approached him and asked if she could feed the birds. He put some seed in her hand. The birds came and perched on the ends of her fingers. Joy flooded through her.

Such a simple pleasure. This was the life!

Alice walked, for one last time, up to Trafalgar Square. She wanted to browse some of the bookshops on Charing Cross Road.

One last coffee and then it was time to go.

Alice believed in quality of life rather than quantity. She had lived more in the past 48 years than the previous 43 years. She was reconciled to the inevitable. She had nowhere else to be, and no-one to be with. She would do this her way.

Alice turned the corner on to Oxford Street. It was heaving with people, as usual.

Across the road, she saw her parents waiting for her.

Alice glanced at her watch. It was 15:08.

She looked to her right and then stepped off the pavement on to the road. The number 25 bus to Oxford Circus hit her and killed her outright.

She got up, apparently unscathed. Running to her parents, she hugged them, reunited, her heart full of joy.

In the middle of the road, people flocked to help the woman lying there but it was already too late.

Somewhere in a Records Office, a printer whirred into action.
