## don't die with your music still in you

_When first my Mum died, then my Dad, I glimpsed my own mortality._

The last in our family line, some baton now passed to me. Until then, the clock had been merrily ticking away as if life would continue for ever.

Then I met Joy Marsden. A great public speaker, vivacious and inspiring. Not long after our meeting she, too, died. At the age of 57. Until the weekend I read this news, I'd been chugging along. My dreams were intact, simmering away on some back burner. Waiting for one day. Some day never.

That day only comes when we grasp the nettle. When we step towards the life we want. And step away from what we don't want.

## later is an illusion

I saw no possibility of making my dreams real. Certainly not until _later_. 'Dreams come true' referred to other people, not me. My dreams would be waiting for me when I retired.

But life has its own plans. The later we envisage always looks a bit different when it actually arrives.

## the dream is the message

In Illusions, Richard Bach writes: _You are never given a dream without also being given the power to make it true._ The dream doesn't just come to us, we have to pursue it.

_“Don’t die with your music still in you. Don’t die with your purpose unfulfilled. Don’t die feeling as if your life has been wrong. Don’t let that happen to you” ~ Wayne Dyer_

The music won’t be denied. It will keep singing to you until you either take notice or you die.
