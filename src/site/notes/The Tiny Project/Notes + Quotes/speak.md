## making the self who will speak

> “Writing is often treated as a project of making things, one piece at a time, but you write from who you are and what you care about and what true voice is yours and from leaving all the false voices and wrong notes behind, and so underneath the task of writing a particular piece is the general one of making a self who can make the work you are meant to make.
> 
> It formalizes the process everyone goes through, of making the self who will speak, of settling on what values and interests and priorities will shape your path and persona.”
>
