## getting on

*Helen Garner’s essay in Griffith Review 68: Getting On*

How will I pass the day? Why will I get up in the morning? And what about the things that are swarming all around at me at every moment? Who’s going to see them, record them, save them from oblivion? How will the world continue to exist if I don’t keep writing about it?

But mostly I wrote it for the hell of it, because I really love writing. I mean, I love a pen and paper. I love words and sentences, and the way you can knit them together and shift them around and pile them up and spread them out. I love the way the raw material of an ordinary day doesn’t start to reveal its deeper meaning until you’ve got the pen in your hand and you’re halfway down the page.

But the force that draws a writer to one story rather than another does not tap politely at the front door. It shoots an invisible arrow into some murky region of the writer’s unknown needs, and hits a target she didn’t even know was there. That’s when the trouble starts.

You have to believe, against the scornful trumpeting of your intellect, in the miraculous ability of form to create itself out of chaos. You have to hold the line through all the wretched days, months, even years that you spend not writing – doing anything but write: “wasting time”, indulging in displacement activities, wandering about pointlessly, biting people’s heads off, seething with anxiety and self-reproach. You have to believe that you’re preparing the ground for something to manifest out of the darkness, to present itself, to be born. Having already gone through this process countless times does not help. You forget, every single time, that it’s coming at you. The anxiety, the self-reproach are always total, unremitting, inescapable. You have to submit to it, allow yourself to suffer it, right to the end.

“Are you going to keep on writing about us?” says my 15-year-old grandson in the kitchen, dashing off the crossword that I have cursed and abandoned.

“I don’t know.” I look up guiltily. “Would you rather I stopped?”

A long pause.

“No,” he says, with his philosophical smile. “I don’t think you should stop.”

“Why not?”

“Because,” butts in his 12-year-old brother, bouncing his football in a forceful rhythm, “it shows – that we – exist.”
