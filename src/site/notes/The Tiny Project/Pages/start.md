I'm Nicola, and I'm most at home with tech, spending time with cows and being out in nature.

## the tiny project

The Tiny Project 2023 is the antidote to big goals and overwhelm, but a way to get things done. Throughout the year I’ll be writing tiny blogs and articles, making tiny videos, and recording tiny podcasts. The project is open to anyone who would like to join me and create their own tiny project.

I believe that we can change the world when we live life gently. The Tiny Project brings together all that I've learned through living at a gentler pace, writing about the Essence Map, and Oneness.

“The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard. There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed. Most people die with everything still inside of them. The way to live is to create. Die empty. Get every idea out of your head and into reality. Calling yourself creative doesn’t make it true. Make finishing your top priority.” ~ Derek Sivers, How to Live
