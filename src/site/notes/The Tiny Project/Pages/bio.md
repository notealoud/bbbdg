## 🌳 about me

I'm a writer, podcaster and photographer. I live in a small village in the Peak Park area of Derbyshire with my husband, [Chris](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk), and his Guide Dog, Bamber.

I'm fascinated by essence - yours and mine. It is a theme that has followed me around for the last couple of decades. I dream of a day when people everywhere reconnect to their own essence and rediscover who they truly are and what they love - then we can change the world.

I believe that living and working at a gentler pace is the key. There is a global shift taking place in which we all have a part to play. Following our bliss, pursuing joy are ways forward. They can help us create the type of world we want to live in.

I believe in oneness. That we all originate from the same Source. And that we are on a journey to understand our connection to one another.

I'm an INFP. I'm unconventional, quirky, an introvert and live outside the circle. That might make me eccentric.

I have an eclectic range of interests.

## writing

I write about the intersection between tech and living at a gentler pace. I'm exploring the premise that, if more of us lived a gentle life, reconnected to who we truly are, or our essence, as I call it, we could change the world for the better. 

## more about me

I'm a Journeywoman, forging my own path from disenchantment to fulfilment, and following the route map, defined by my own experiences.

I started to feel out of kilter in my 30s. I felt there had to be more to life than the conventional day jobs I worked. I thought there had to be another way but what?

I was 54 when I finally made the leap. The deaths of both my parents and of someone I admired, were the catalysts I needed to resign from my job and start to find another way.

I didn't have a plan. Simply a desire to plough my own furrow and live a different life.

In 2020, I relocated from Manchester to Derbyshire, another milestone on my path.

And I began to live my dream life.

It's now time to share everything I've learned about living at a gentler pace, to step up, be brave and visible, be my weird and quirky self. But, most of all, to be true to my own essence and who I am.

It's a journey that continues. I hope you'll join me!

## what I believe

> I believe that, when we are who we are meant to be, we can change the world.

**oneness** ~ I believe life's challenges have the potential to be a catalyst for each of us to find our way home, but also to recognise that we all originate from the same source, leading us to acknowledge that we are all one. When we understand this, we will have the power to create a global revolution.

**the unconventional life** ~ I've always preferred the road less travelled. I've been called eccentric and quirky. I value the freedom to live life on my terms and not follow the crowd. I'm [a Provocateur](http://www.howtofascinate.com/) and my default setting is to challenge the status quo and look for alternatives. I'm a quiet rebel.

**creativity and flow** ~ I believe creativity provides the route to our essential selves, to our souls, to our essence, and connects us to the divine. It's through our creative pursuits that we can find our flow and access our own wisdom. It's in flow that our dreams take root and we tap into the universal mind.

**living seasonally** ~ my dream is to embrace a simpler way of life, aligned with the seasons. I want to spend time outdoors every day to watch the year unfold, and to nurture my connection to nature. I believe nature holds the answers and shows us the best way to take care of the planet.

> The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the Universe, to match your nature with Nature ~ Joseph Campbell

Finding out who we are, understanding what bring us joy and purpose, and connecting with our essence are the keys that align us with the core essence of the natural world.

I believe that by taking better care of ourselves first, and then our family, friends and neighbours, we will not only build better communities but naturally have a greater desire to care for our planet.

Until we see each other as members of the same community, understand how we are all connected by virtue of our humanity, we will never have the impetus to do what is necessary to heal the planet.

Global events are catalysts to bring us together in community and serve as opportunities for change.

We need to recognise our relationship to our world and the connection that exists between us, every living thing and the planet.

If we all did those things that make us happy and bring us fulfilment, the net effect would be to make the world a better place.

Living seasonally, and adopting the rhythms of nature could have a far reaching impact on climate change and our environment.

## join me

If, like me, you've often felt like a square peg in a round hole who didn't fit in, you've experienced your own life changes, and are looking for ways to reconnect, reboot and realign, let me be your guide and light the way forward.

I believe that positive change starts when we embrace those things that bring us joy and fulfilment and I’m convinced that living at a gentler pace of life helps not only us, our neighbours and the people we love, but also the planet.

> We are all One
