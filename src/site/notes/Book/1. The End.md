> People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.

## A Leap of Faith

[Joe versus the Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Versus_the_Volcano) is the story of a hypochondriac living a half life, working a dead end job. Diagnosed with a terminal condition, his doctor urges him to go and really live, while he can. 

With nothing to lose, Joe quits his job and the next day meets a business man intent on mining a rare element from a remote island. Standing in his way is a tribe who will only allow access if someone is provided as a sacrifice to the fire god. They must jump into the volcano.

Believing he is dying anyway, Joe agrees. 

Still a hypochondriac he starts out on an adventure. Along the way he realises that he could have lived a different life.

He meets Patricia who tells him:

> My father says almost the whole world's asleep. Everybody you know, everybody you see, everybody you talk to. He says only a few people are awake. And they live in a state of constant total amazement.

They travel on Patricia's boat to the island with the volcano and hit a typhoon along the way. The boat sinks, Patricia is knocked unconscious and Joe keeps her alive by giving her capfulls of bottled water. He doesn't drink any himself and becomes delirious. 

One night he watches the moon emerge on the horizon and realises how small he is yet how grateful he is for his life.

Patricia recovers and makes Joe drink water. They arrive at the island.

After they are prepared for the jump into the volcano, the chief asks if any of the islanders are willing to be a hero and sacrifice themselves in the volcano. None are willing. They are afraid to die.

Before Joe can jump in the volcano, Patricia declares her love for him and asks him not to jump. 

Joe says:

> I've wasted my whole life.  And now I'm going to die.  I've got a chance to die like a man and I'm going to take it!  I've got to take it!

Ready to jump, Patricia says she will jump with him. 

They jump into the volcano but are thrown back out.

Later they find themselves on the twin of Patricia's boat and Joe discovers that he never had a brain cloud but was lied to by a friend of Patricia's father, posing as a doctor. Patricia's father would do anything to gain the mineral rights.

*The moral of the story? Even when you think your life is over, it isn't necessarily so. Sometimes you have to make a leap of faith.*

> Everyone at some point finds themselves in the ashes of life and longs for home. The real home turns out to be the center within each life and each return to that inner core not only calms us, heals us and makes us whole, but also adds some healing and wholeness to the world around us. When the end seems near, it becomes time to seek the center within and find ways to be central to the healing of the scorched and scarred earth around us. The great tragedies and dramas of life and the threat of it all ending try to return humanity to an awareness of the eternal presence of the divine waiting at the center of each life and all of life.

## Why Walking Through Fire Is Our Way Home

I've believed, for some time, that we are on the cusp of a new beginning. Pre-2012, there was a sense of something coming although I had no idea what that might be.

I was learning through my own experiences and the creation of the Essence Map that endings were not to be feared. They were markers, catalysts and pivotal moments to shake up our lives and putting us on a different track, one that would lead us closer back to ourselves.

Today, the signs of many endings are all around us. Globally, nationally and personally. All of these events are milestones that indicate the seismic shifts coming our way.

I talk, a lot in the Essence Map, about endings and how they are simply precursors of new beginnings. But, first, we have to adapt to change and spend some time in the Void while we regroup and come to terms with a different future.

> We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.
> 
> Albert Einstein

Call me a simple soul but I believe that the answers we are looking for come from within, not outside ourselves. There’s a place where we connect with our true essence – that zero point where we are in flow, where we embrace what brings us joy and we experience peace. It’s in that space that we find the insights we seek.

It’s in the quiet and stillness of a solitary walk, in nature and among trees that we hear the whisper of our intuition, when we understand what’s real and what’s simply an illusion.

When we are immersed in creating or making and we feel at one with the world, and we catch a glimpse of something other worldly, and of our own genius.

When we’re challenged by change it’s easy to stay in our comfort zone, afraid of what might come next. The secret, though, is to go with it. Allow the shifts to move you forward. To wade through the mud, to walk through the storm, to follow where your heart leads, and to brave the heat of the fire because you will eventually emerge, altered.

It’s in those endings that we have the power to redefine who we are and to create our future. It is in our hands.

But the journey is for us to travel alone. On that road, we will meet with our fellow travellers and recognise ourselves in them. It is only when we truly see each other that we understand our shared purpose.

I wish for you to have the courage to step back when everyone else rushes forward, to listen to your heart and soul and know what truth is for you, to be able to walk through the fire knowing that is the only way home.

## A Global Pivotal Moment

My take on life has never been mainstream. From being a child, I've always been open minded about alternative views of life. My Dad and I watched a lot of sci-fi, talked about the possibilities behind unsolved mysteries, and both believed in the existence of aliens!

I discovered, about ten years ago, that one of my archetypes is [the Provocateur](https://www.howtofascinate.com/). It explained a lot - my default unconventional setting, my view of the world that was most often the polar opposite of everyone else's. Something I'd played down and suppressed, now I saw it as a strength. 

I never suggest that I am right about my conclusions or what I choose to believe. Until the final outcome, in many cases, we can only speculate. I like to see the world from my perspective and contemplate what this reveals to me. I look below the surface, not for the obvious but for what might be unspoken. 

### 2012

I need to take you back. To my early twenties.

Throughout my childhood and teens, I'd always gone to Sunday School and church. My Dad was a Sunday School teacher and also a local preacher. I became a Sunday School teacher too. Around the time I moved to London at 18, I had already decided to draw a line in the sand

My philosophy of life had been changing. Somehow I was concluding that there was a different explanation. It seemed rather presumptuous. Until I came across [this](https://delphinius56.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/hindu-legend-of-humans-divinity/):

_There is a Hindu legend about a time when all humans were gods, but they abused their divinity. Brahma, the chief god, decided to take it away from them and hide it where they would never find it again._

_Brahma called a council of the gods to help him decide where to hide the divinity. “Let’s bury it deep in the earth.” But Brahma said, “No, that will not do; one day they will dig deep down into the earth and find it.”_

_Then the gods said, “Let’s sink it in the deepest ocean.” Again Brahma replied, “No, not there, for they will learn to dive into the deepest waters, and search the ocean bed and find it.”_

_Then they said, “Let’s take it to the top of the highest mountain and hide it there.” But again Brahma replied, “No, for eventually humans will climb every high mountain on earth; someday they will find it again.”_

_The gods gave up and said, “We do not know where to hide it, for it seems there is no place on the earth or in the sea that humans will not eventually reach.”_

_Brahma thought for a long time and said, “Here is what we will do with humanity’s divinity. We will hide it deep down inside humans themselves. The humans will search the whole world, but they won’t look for it inside their true selves.”_

_Ever since then, the legend concludes, humans have been going to and fro throughout the earth, climbing, digging, diving, exploring, and searching for something that is already within themselves._

It made perfect sense and described where my thinking was taking me. That I was god. It made no sense yet it made complete sense. The idea required more exploration but, for the moment and secretly, I believed what I was contemplating, even though I didn't appreciate the implications.

All I knew was: if I am god, then we are all god.

Over time my thinking evolved. I saw myself as part of the divine. A living being who evolved from the same Source as the energy that had created both me and the Universe. I was made of the same stuff. I was a creator too. 

As Marianne Williamson says:

*Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone.*

I began to come across others who shared my philosophy. What had seemed far out when I first considered it, was becoming more widespread.

I read extensively. Most weekends would find me in Waterstone's looking at the Mind Body Spirit section. I read everything that appealed to me. Each book taking me down a new rabbit hole.

I read, first, about the 1987 Harmonic Convergence. And then 2012.

The end of the world or just the end of the world as we know it?

I really went down some funky rabbit holes with this one! Thanks to the internet I was able to find lots of esoteric content and I loved it.

Around 2010, I started a Cosmic Circle. A meditation group where I shared some of the ideas I was exploring. A core group attended every fortnight, gathering in my tiny living room, talking, drinking tea and eating cake. Then, for me at least, before 2012 even arrived the purpose of the group was over. Energetically, 2012 had already happened.

2012 was not a specific date. It was a marker for the end of the world as we know it. The closing of one cycle and the beginning of the next. Change on a global scale doesn't happen overnight. It's a process and an evolution. It's still happening now and being called an Awakening. A time to make people aware of their potential and that of the world around them, and to facilitate a shift in consciousness.

Nothing is by chance but part of a larger process. Where you see global endings, the world at large is being placed into a void which will, ultimately, lead us to a new beginning. 

The Essence Map plots the route we take through endings and new beginnings. It maps the milestones so that we know what to expect and to give us the comfort of the light waiting for us at the end of the tunnel.

Whether we crave the old normal, endings always move us forward. We are in the throes of creating a new normal and it will look like nothing we have experienced before.

> The secret to change is to focus all your energy, not on fighting the old, but in building the new.

## Change

We are naturally programmed not to like change. We prefer the comfort of life as we know it. Despite challenges which inevitably appear, our default setting is to maintain the status quo.

We will cling on to our normal lives for as long as we can.

But change is inevitable. If we are to grow, our lives are underpinned by change. It catapults us to the next phase of our life or, in the case of an entire planet, to the next cycle of our evolution.

We saw an End in early 2020 when lockdown 1.0 came into effect, and started a global journey through the Essence Map.

Endings are typically connected with loss of some sort. The loss of a job, the loss of a loved one, a relationship or, a way of life.
  
Endings can be shocking. Depending on the circumstances, they can shake us to our core. They can impact our physical body as well as our mental state.

But endings catapult us to a new place, somewhere we're meant to be for our personal growth, and set off a chain of events that lead us forward.

### Resistance is futile

It's natural to resist change. But it is often a sign that we have outgrown a situation or a new chapter is waiting to begin.

I began to recognise my own endings in my twenties when I changed jobs several times, including once due to the death of my boss, another time, a failing business. Living alone in London, from pay cheque to pay cheque, I had to keep myself afloat. 

The initial panic about finding a new job soon subsided once everything came together and a new opportunity presented itself. In my thirties, a rapid succession of jobs during the internet boom led me from one stepping stone to another and I began to see that there was a plan at play.

My relationships also followed the same path. A brief foray into marriage, aged thirty, sent me into an abyss. It would take me years to fathom the reason why it had fallen apart. Another very on/off relationship in my forties sent me through a spiral of repeated endings and beginnings.

> It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.
> 
>  Joseph Campbell

But, these experiences clarified the route map that I was navigating and, I saw, as I looked back on life, that everything always worked out, one way or another. Even when I couldn't see a way out, life brought me to a better place.

## Crossing the Threshold

> A crisis is a holy summons to cross a threshold. It involves both a leaving behind and a stepping toward, a separation and an opportunity.
>
> The word crisis derives from the Greek words krisis and krino, which mean “a separating.” The very root of the world implies that our crises are times of severing from old ways and states of being. We need to ask ourselves what it is we’re being asked to separate from. What needs to be left behind?
>
> Sue Monk Kidd

I was probably in my thirties when I noticed that we sometimes have a choice with change. We may see it coming (perhaps the end of a relationship, the loss of a job) and, in that moment, we can choose our next step. Will we wait and sit it out, or will we take the bull by the horns?

If we decide to wait, we may experience the kick in the seat of the pants. 

Those red flags or other indicators - niggles, as I like to call them - are our first indications that something is amiss. They are the precursors to an easier way out. They give you choice, time to prepare, an opportunity to be proactive. When the writing is on the wall, it can only mean one thing. 

I learned the hard way!

I've worked in companies where we were assured that our jobs were secure. We chose to believe what we were being told despite being pretty sure that the opposite was true. After all, they couldn't be lying to us. Could they? I remember one job where we had been reassured that all was well only for the next day to be called into an all staff meeting and advised that we were all out of a job. 

All the warning signs were there with my brief 11 month marriage. My Mum and Dad saw it before me. They discouraged me from getting married but I had to work it out for myself. Within two months, I could have walked away. There was nothing I could put my finger on but there was something. My gut was telling me that things were amiss. I remember days at work wondering what was going on and then getting home and not being able to find anything wrong. 

Then, one morning, on April Fool's Day, I woke up, looked across at him and thought, I'm done. Later that day I left. A month later I went back with a van for my furniture. I never spoke to him again.

I spent the next six months wondering what I had done wrong. I would lie in bed, night after night, turning things over in my head, trying to come to a logical conclusion. But there was none. It would be five more years before everything was done and dusted.

In hindsight, the niggles had always been there. I chose to ignore them and paid the price, literally and metaphorically.

It put me on a track that I hadn't imagined. I'd always thought I would be married and have children. I'd loved babysitting for friends and dreamed of a family of my own. I remember one day talking to my Dad about an old school friend who had just had a baby, and wondering why it wasn't happening for me. I decided that, if I still hadn't had children by the time I was 40, I would give up on the idea.

> We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
> 
> Joseph Campbell

The big theme of the Essence Map is about this. Sometimes the life we think we want isn't our destiny.

Chris thought he was going to be a biker, learn to fly, but he was destined to become a blind Woodturner and it changed his life in ways he could never have imagined. And changed other people's lives too.

Whenever you are challenged with change, look at where you can embrace it. Contemplate a different future. Know that your future will always open up in exactly the way it's meant to.

> ... centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn. They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right?
>
> But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent. And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this. It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align. And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human. He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity.
>
> And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name. They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, “Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.” That's God, you know.
