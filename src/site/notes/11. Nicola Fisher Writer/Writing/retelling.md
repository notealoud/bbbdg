## the retelling of alice's story

A couple of years ago we were driving to a woodturning weekend when an idea popped into my head – to write a fictionalised account of the life of my maternal grandmother. I started thinking about her life and the many challenges she had faced, and the thought that it could make a fascinating story began to percolate. I’d already done a lot of research on my family tree several years before but, over the weekend, I renewed my Ancestry subscription and started delving into that branch of the family coming up with some new details and it started looking even more interesting.

On and off since then, I’ve been researching a few conundrums and contemplating the facts as part of a life story rather than just records on a website. How do you deal with four of your children dying, three in infancy and the other aged 12? How do you keep it all together when your mother dies and you’re then responsible for your father and umpteen other siblings, while holding down a job and walking miles back and forth to work every day? What’s your opinion of your husband’s mother taking up with a man almost twenty years her junior and bearing his children?

The research has been compelling. Whenever I’ve had a moment, I’ve had a quick look at one or other of the characters. There are a couple of dark horses in amongst them. I love that one of them lived next door to a chip potato shop. That’s definitely going in the book. Several of the family were itinerant, starting off life in Warwickshire and then travelling to Yorkshire before settling in Lancashire. One of my grandmother’s uncles was a hatter. Because of the mercury used in the hat making process, many hatters suffered from mercury poisoning, which gave rise to the term [_mad as a hatter_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erethism). This will make a sidenote to the story.

While I have a lot of data to work with, as well as stories my Mum told me, plus a few others I’ve learned over the years, inevitably I’m going to have to fill in some gaps. Call it poetic licence, call it educated guessing, some of the detail I’m going to have to make up.

What I have, though, is a brilliant starting point. By basing the book around my family tree timeline, and specifically Alice’s life, I’ve got the back story to work with and a potential outline.

At the moment, this is an _as and when_ project but I’m thrilled by it and it often occupies my thoughts. I’ve jotted down names, dates and facts in my Lemome notebook and on random pieces of paper as I've discovered them. Each find sparks new ideas.

When the idea first popped into my head I had no idea how I would approach the writing. I didn’t think I would ever contemplate writing fiction (although that has changed) and this was going to be an amalgam of fact and fiction. Alice was never, as far as I know, a diary writer but perhaps another character could be, and I can use that as the device for telling the story. I’ve yet to decide.

I've mapped out many of the characters and their back stories on index cards. Apart from Alice, I’m going to change their names. While historical accuracy isn’t critical in some areas, I want to research events of the day and incorporate some of those into the story.

I’ve looked at the family tree in a new light and, although I never knew the vast majority of people listed, they're being brought back to life again.

Of course, the postscript to this is Obsidian. A few years ago when I started thinking about this idea, Obsidian didn't even exist. I tried using Scrivener but it didn't have that join the dots functionality that Obsidian does. It's definitely going to come into its own as I put together the story of Alice and all the members of our family that I never knew.
