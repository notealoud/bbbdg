## have you found your rat people?

Many moons ago, I came across Paul Jarvis. I found his style and process compelling. I loved his clean and simple website. Over the years I introduced Paul's writing to many friends and colleagues.

Paul often talked about his pet rats in his newsletter and and referred to those who valued what he did as his rat people. Those who got and appreciated his work.

> You need to find your rat people. Not literally “rat people”, unless rats really are your thing. I’m talking about the people that get what you do, appreciate it, and love you for it. Everyone else? You can safely ignore ~ Paul Jarvis

When A Gentler Pace was still the mere hint of an idea, I knew that I wanted to create something whose focus was on slowing down, travelling at a gentler pace yet still having time to watch the world go by or to smell the roses and the coffee, and nurturing the spirit leaving a trail for others to follow – should they wish.

I wanted to step away from the conventional 9-5, Monday to Friday and carve out a more unconventional niche of my own, exploring the possibilities of building an online business that could sustain me yet be more aligned to the seasons of the natural world rather than the self-imposed commercial and industrial rhythms.

My hope is that I will find my own rat people along the way, others who, like me, want to adopt a different pace of life while still sharing their skills and passions, and supporting themselves financially.

I’m on a quest to find that something else. A different way of being and living that makes sense and provides the personal fulfilment that many of us crave.
