## how I met Bill Murray in Paris

In 1984 I lived in Paris, studying at the Sorbonne as part of my French degree.

I'd heard rumours that Bill Murray was in town. Ghostbusters was just out and he'd been making The Razor's Edge. After filming, he decided to stay on to study.

I never spotted him until, one day, I was waiting for my next class when Bill came walking down the steps. I was starstruck in those days and asked if he would sign my autograph book. It was Easter. He wrote Merry Xmas!

This was the city of Shakespeare & Co. My landlady was a Madame Figaro journalist. A friend was an aspiring novelist. I started jotting in my Gibert Jeune notebooks.

I dreamed of interviewing Bill Murray. Another day I spotted his distinctive walk as he headed towards the Seine and ducked into a patisserie. He came out with a palmier and offered me some. Although he declined an interview we chatted for a while. Later I cobbled together some notes from our conversation. I still have those notes.

On 8 May a big VE day celebration closed the entire Champs Elysees to traffic. It was a sea of people. As I walked up, coming down straight towards me was Bill. Without thinking, I reached over and grabbed his arm and said hello!

There were so many magical moments in Paris that year and this chance encounter was one of them.

Later Paris Match mentioned his favourite restaurant. By then Bill had gone back home but one of the waiters took me to the house next door. There on the gate was a sign: M et Mme B Murray.
