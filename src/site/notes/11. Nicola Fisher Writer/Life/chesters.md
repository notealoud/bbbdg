## chesters

I was just looking at this note: [[11. Nicola Fisher Writer/Life/mugs\|mugs]]. I clicked on the link for Chesters and found it was broken so I Googled to fix the link.

The website has nothing on it. Their Instagram account hasn't been updated in weeks and the reviews are sad.

I remember so many visits to Chesters. It was my favourite place to go for lunch or coffee and sumptuous cake. I went there countless times with my Mum and Dad on day trips to the Lakes. 

There were lovely tables, some sofas, fab decor. The shop was expensive but always full to the gills with beautiful things.

On one solo stay in the Lakes, my Mum and Dad popped over for the day. We lunched at Chesters. The following day I went back for breakfast, and missed being there with my parents. One of the staff brought me extra hot milk for my coffee and made a fuss of me.

Over the years, things started to change. I can't remember our last visit there. It's been several years. Possibly pre-2016, when my Dad died. I think he and I went to Chesters but it wasn't the same.

Gone were the nice tables and chairs, and sofas. They were replaced by school dining room furniture - benches and long communal tables. 

Now, according to the reviews, it's declined even further. Self-service and clean up after yourselves.

Chesters was an iconic place in the Lake District. I have so many memories there. It was a constant in my life.
