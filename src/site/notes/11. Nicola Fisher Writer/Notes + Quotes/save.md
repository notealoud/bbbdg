## don't try to save the whole world

> When people ask me how and why I did it, I only have one answer- Soul. Not masochism, not the need to be acknowledged but, instead, the deep need to fully excavate and actualize my soul’s voice- my reasons for being, my entelechy, what James Hillman called the ‘innate image’. It was like a desperate longing to be who I was called to become in this lifetime. And as difficult as it was to find and live that voice, it was easier than the uncomfortable alternative. It was easier than living a lie.
>
> Wherever you are on your journey through time, be assured that there is a soul path somewhere at the heart of it.
> 
> When you walk through the gateway of your sacred purpose, you walk into yourself. Blessingly buffered from the madness of the world, your purpose ﬁlters out those relationships and energies that undermine your expansion.
> 
> Don’t lose the faith, wherever you are on the path. Keep going.
> 
> Jeff Brown
