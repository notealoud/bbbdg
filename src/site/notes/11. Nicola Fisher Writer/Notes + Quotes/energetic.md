## ideas are a disembodied, energetic life form

> “Ideas are a disembodied, energetic life form. They are completely separate from us but capable of interacting with us-albeit strangely. And the only way an idea can be made manifest in our world is through collaboration with a human partner. It is only through a human's efforts that an idea can be escorted out of the ether and into the realm of the actual.”
