## 'ey up

This has been a quiet week in terms of diary writing. I got into something of a routine. Arrived at the car park just before 08:00 and then either had a walk around the canals, Roman ruins, G-Mex area or made a mad dash to Starbucks. Decided not to do that again though. By the time I'd got there, ordered my coffee and sat down it was pretty much time to leave. That Starbucks is up near St Peter's square and it's "OK" but not as nice as the one in St Ann's Square or the one on Deansgate. On Thursday I went into the "Y" Club and got a coffee there. As I was going in Allan Beswick, a minor celeb and presenter on BBC Radio GMR, was coming out. I saw him again on the Friday.

Work had also fallen into something of a routine punctuated with a bit of computer troubleshooting and negotiating the purchase of a "Moulin" in France. En francais, bien sur. 

So, here we are ... Saturday again and already we're in June. The sun has come out in force today, in preparation for the Jubilee long weekend. Surprisingly I've heard very little about what's going on over the weekend - apart from the Party at the Palace when Ozzy Osbourne is going to sing "Paranoid". That, I have to see! And apparently Brian May is kicking off the event by performing on the roof of Buck House.

I went into Manchester today and like a muppet left my camera at home. I really don't know why I did that. The [Urbis](https://web.archive.org/web/20021201034335/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/001ewm/024_urbis_media/%22) garden is now open and it really is stunning. The grass is lush and green. There's a little waterway encompassing the garden with mini waterfalls (really tiny), the brass designs rusting nicely in the water. In the centre of the grass, dotted around at random, are stone "seats", some punctuated with pebbles. And at either end is a water feature. At the Victoria station end there's a low pool with water fountains coming out of it and the carved wooden posts. I really must take some photos of them. They're quite lovely. At the other end is a larger waterfall with steps and on each step is a big leaf. Each leaf has part of a line of a [John Donne](https://web.archive.org/web/20021201034335/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/rp/poems/donne19.html) poem on it.

> No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace  
> As I have seen in one autumnal face.

I always think if you're going to build something why not make it nice. And in this case, they have. Lots of lovely details. People were looking at all the bits and pieces and trying to work out the words on the leaves.

I can't believe I hadn't taken my camera. Duh!

It was really nice in Manchester. Surprisingly quiet. Maybe everyone's gone away or gone to London. I didn't want a lot. A couple of birthday pressies, a small bottle of bubble bath for next week (more of that later). It was really nice and sunny and it was bliss to have time to wander without rushing around like a maniac. I had been thinking of getting a throw away camera. For next week. I love my digital camera but once the card is full, that's it. Then I had a bright idea ... get another Smart Media card. So, I went to Jessop's and got a 32M card. They're much cheaper now. So, I've got a 4M (that came with the camera), a 16M (that I bought a while ago and it cost an arm and a leg) and now the 32M ... making 52M altogether. I don't like having to be judicious about the number of photos I take. I just like being able to snap away. Now I have some back up.

Nipped into Paperchase for a notebook ... for next week. And then went into the Triangle. Had a coffee in Caffe Nero and read the Guardian. Various articles about where I'm going next week. And went into Mikey and bought some mad earrings for next week too.

*Mad earrings*

As you can see attractively displayed on a teacup on top of the bin! You just get such good light there and a conveniently flat display area.

And next week ... I'm going to the [Hay Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20021201034335/http://www.hayfestival.co.uk/). Yippee. I'm so looking forward to it. For the uninitiated, it's a book festival. There are around 39 bookshops. Hay is the book capital of the UK. It's just books, books and more books. The Hay Festival, this year sponsored by the Guardian, attracts various authors who speak at the different events. One of this year's big authors is Maya Angelou. Not managed to get tickets for her event but am hoping that I might manage to get a stand by ticket ... if I'm very lucky. I'm just looking forward to a few days away from it all, a bit of piece and quiet, and doing something I've wanted to do for a few years but not had the opportunity.

It's also called the Glastonbury of the book world and attracts something of a hippy contingent (so I'm told). Hence the earrings. That's as hippy as I get.

It's an absolutely gorgeous day here. My first poppy has opened. They're sprawling at the bottom of the garden. I sometimes prop them up with stakes but it looks such a mess so this year I think I'll just let them do their own thing.

Have been very industrious this afternoon. Done some tidying up, washing and gave Tallulah a bath. Attempted to take some photos whilst she was in the bath. A few more photo opportunities than usual but even so still managed to miss her altogether several times! This was the best of the bunch.

Made some soup as well which I think I will call "Vampire's Brew" because I put loads of garlic in it.  

Called round at my Mum and Dad's and went into the garden to take some photos. They get a lot of birds visiting them. Lots of blue tits, finches and blackbirds. Some blackbirds are nesting in one of the bushes in the back garden and there are some in the front garden. Lots of blue tits nip inside the bird house but, so far, none have nested in there. It's been well used though!
