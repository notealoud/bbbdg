# TGIF

Having a bit of a Shackleton week. Tomorrow there's a programme on Channel 4 about the making of "Shackleton". I also found some good sites about the filming. I think I said (somewhere) that Channel 4 spent £10m on the making of "Shackleton". In fact, according to what I read today it was closer to £40m.

The roads have been fairly quiet this week. A lot of people don't go back to work until Monday. I think the kids are still off school as well which always makes a difference. Am going to try to get up earlier from next week so that I don't have to sit in a queue on the motorway every day. It's much less frustrating to be able to drive rather than shuffle forward.

The general plan as well is to go to the gym first thing (06:30). I will probably swim. The thought of pumping iron at that ungodly hour of the morning is not appealing. I think I could cope with swimming though. I'm not mad keen on the gym and even less keen on it after a day at work. I find it really anti-social. People are not at all chatty.

It's nice having had a short working week though. Next week is going to be a shock to the system.
