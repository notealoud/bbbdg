## my early days with obsidian

[[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] is a recent discovery. I've used apps with some similarities in the past - ones that let you load up the file in a text reader, link up ideas (I used an app called [The Brain](https://www.thebrain.com/) several years ago) or take text notes. But Obsidian does something much better.

It takes your notes and lets you make connections between them. You can be strategic with your folders or you can simply go with the flow and allow your notes to develop organically.

Like a Second Brain, Obsidian lets me make notes the way my brain works. It makes total sense to me!

My notes are located in Dropbox so app-independent. You can store them in a variety of places like Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive. Dropbox works well with 1Writer (and I like the interface), so that's why I've settled on this configuration.

## observations

I've been using Obsidian for about a week now and it's definitely a game changer. Having a usable repository for ideas, references, quotes and my daily notes has lit my creative spark. I think this is because there's no requirement to finish articles or writing but simply to write and compile. Sometimes the need to finish a blog post has stymied me - I don't always have all my thinking complete. With Obsidian the trend is to separate writing out into categories such as seedling, budding and evergreen.

I'm enjoying the geekiness of it. Obsidian is a bit of a DIY tool. You can set it up exactly how you want, you can customise it and use add-ons to make it yours. I added a plugin yesterday that extracts to do items from all my notes into a single list. 

Although I loved the earlier template I was using, I've settled on a white background template called Minimal. It's probably an easier reading experience. It also has much prettier checklist icons!
