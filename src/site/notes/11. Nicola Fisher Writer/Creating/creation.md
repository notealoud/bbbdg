## creation is hard

God might have taken only 7 days to complete his creation but creating online takes a lot longer!

I've been at this for years. Starting back in the late 1990s as a blogger, and then dipping in and out with various projects since. Nothing really stuck. I started, ran for a finite length of time and then ran out of steam. Some time late I'd raze everything to the ground. 

Rinse and repeat. 

I've always juggled creating with a day job. Squeezing my creativity into snatched time. As the years have gone on, it's become harder and harder. 

My energy levels have been sapped. The well is empty. I give my all to my non-creative work so there's little left over. 

A side effect of this is lack of self-belief. You start with the best of intentions. You're enthusiastic. Time elapses. No one is reading your stuff. Or listening to your podcasts. You've backed yourself in a corner with nowhere to go. 

You conclude your work must be rubbish. And what do you do with rubbish? You burn it. 

And there we are. Back at the beginning again. 

It's frustrating. It's annoying. 

Any momentum you might be gaining is lost. You have to start over. 

The challenge for me is then finding a new direction. Where do I go from here? What do I focus on now?

You start with a theme. Living at a gentler pace. Working on tiny projects. But it's too narrow, too restrictive. After a while you have nothing more to say. You stop posting. You dry up. And then it's over. 

Rinse and repeat. 

I watch people create week in, week out. Something new and captivating. How do they do it? Sometimes they talk about their process. I read those posts voraciously. Searching for clues and some secret blueprint. 

In the final analysis, it comes back to me. 

I'm not prioritising my creating. I'm putting my all into work and other stuff, until there's nothing left. 

I don't believe I can do it. Simple as. I doubt myself. 

The well dries up. I don't refill. Then I have a hill to climb. 

Rinse and repeat. 

I should have learned by now. But, no. Here I am back at square one. Working out where I go from here.
