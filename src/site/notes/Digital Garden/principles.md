## create

Creativity emerges from the Void. It makes itself known to us following change, endings, death and loss. Just when we think all is lost, new ideas emerge from the fire we've walked through. The new will always be built. It is the natural order of things.

## creed
Â   
Our Creed underpins our lives. It drives us forward, helps us be clear about our next actions, where we are heading, how we engage with others.

## oneness

While we do battle with isms, we are lost. It is in realising our connection to one another that we can be found. This is how we will move forward as a society, a planet and a civilisation. Instead of focusing on differences, let's see what we have in common.

## consciousness

We are awakening to possibilities. We are shifting to a deeper awareness of who we truly are. We are shifting into a cosmic consciousness revealing our individual purpose for being here. This is how we understand our oneness. As each of us lights the spark within, we enable others to do the same. This is the energy that will power a new world.

## love

The energy behind the entire Universe. The more we connect, the less we need. We understand our relationship to the planet and the natural world. Less becomes more. Everything we need is available to us and everyone living on this planet. We just need to tap into a new mindset.
