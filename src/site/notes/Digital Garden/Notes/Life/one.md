Every conversation comes back to the same thing right now. Why do we treat people so poorly?

We watched 'Twelve years a slave' and the brutality that one man can deliver on another is incomprehensible. It's happened over centuries if not millennia. It's still happening. Governments perpetuate this cycle. 

In basics such as healthcare there are gaping voids where people's needs are not being met. People always play second fiddle to money. And we know why but it makes no sense.
