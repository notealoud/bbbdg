## the intersection of tech and living a gentle life

I had no idea when I first came across [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] (a [[notetaking\|notetaking]] app - think Evernote with wings) in April earlier this year just how far reaching its impact would be for me.

I'd signed up to Evernote back in 2009 and stuck with it for years until I found, first, Bear and then Notion, followed by a brief dabble with OneNote, and countless other shiny things. I expected Obsidian to be something similar. 

It is and it isn’t.

## second brain

Around the same time, April 2021, I was diving into the concept of a Second Brain.

For me, this is where Obsidian comes into its own. The process of using the app has come closest to replicating the way my brain works. I like the way I can throw in information, sometimes filing it in a handful of folders, but mostly using tags and backlinks to create connections. It lit a fire under me and kept me awake at nights as possibilities would pop into my head which I had to action before I could fall asleep.

What I love most about Obsidian is that it's taken me on a journey and down an gigantic rabbit hole.

## community

Obsidian isn't just an app, it's a community too.

There's an active Discord community which extended my use of Obsidian and inspired me to add a range of plugins, reconfigure my folders, led me to beta test the mobile version and sign up for Publish to make some of my notes public.

### pkm

It was the Discord community that introduced me to the idea of personal knowledge management ([[Digital Garden/Notes/Tech/pkm\|pkm]]). I began harvesting my Kindle highlights and bringing them into Obsidian. I created an Orangery, a directory on my Mac where I could save quotes, extracts from emails and web content using the MarkDownload Chrome extension. This directory is mirrored in my Obsidian Vault and its contents automagically appear in the app.

### twitter

I’d abandoned Twitter some time ago deleting two well-established accounts. I thought I was done with Twitter. But then I discovered that the PKM advocates were active on Twitter. I dipped my toes back in the waters of tweeting.

I found that there had been something of a renaissance on Twitter. Perhaps starting from scratch also helped, and being more mindful of how I curated my feed.

I spotted that there was a new thing called Spaces. The Twitter version of Clubhouse (which I love but find little traction). Twitter might have an advantage in the way users have already established interests.

My fellow PKM fans introduced me to more goodies.

### racket

I love voice. Voxer is my favourite communication tool and I send voicenotes now more often than text. With Racket I can record 9 minutes of voice. A mini podcast. Or, shall we call it an atomic podcast? More on that in a moment.

### revue

I’m a sucker for the new and shiny. Revue is a newsletter tool integrated with Twitter. Followers can subscribe from my profile with a click of a button. Revue synchronises with other tools which makes it great as a digest newsletter.

### workflow

The combination of all of the above has helped me create a more productive and prolific writing practice. At the heart of everything is Obsidian, which is the start and end point of everything I create.

It could have been overwhelming but by streamlining my process, creating a workflow diagram and then replicating that in a ClickUp sequence, I’ve seen where I can work smarter.
