## why I'm obsessed with obsidian

A couple of months ago I happened upon an app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). A note taking app which describes itself as a Second Brain, I was intrigued. I’d been a long term user of Evernote, I’d tried Bear and One Note, I have analogue notes in notebooks but all of these eventually ended up becoming an archive for jottings and ideas, clippings from web pages or books, without real function.

I’d abandoned Bear when it became clear that I hadn’t referred to it in quite a while. Evernote had evolved into storage for scanned documents. But I was also chomping at the bit to spark new ideas. I felt stale and I wasn’t sure of the solution.

Part of the answer turned out to be Obsidian.

I am a geek. I love new tech and shiny objects. Obsidian was soon downloaded and installed, and I began dabbling. I Googled extensively to find others who were using Obsidian and read about their approach to note taking. I researched plugins and add ons. I joined the Discord community and signed up to become an Insider and access the beta mobile app. I took advice from recommendations, best practice, and suggestions made by members of the community, and began to develop my Second Brain organically.

## why is obsidian so great?

The simple answer is, I think it works in a very similar way to my brain.

I’ve always been multi-passionate. My interests range wildly. TE Lawrence, Auriculas, consciousness, Reiki, writing, genius, Paris, street art, grunge photography and, lately, ceramics!

Many newbies to Obsidian say that they could never find a container for all the random ideas they have. Notes would be written on scraps of paper, in a variety of journals, Apple Notes, Evernote. But they became standalone and needed to be corralled in some way to be of any benefit. I could relate to that.

Obsidian is a repository. You can add all your ideas, quotes, references, webpages, books and a whole raft of other notes. By tagging and backlinking you create connections between notes and therein lies the genius of Obsidian.

This process has completely revolutionised my thinking and writing. Where I used to read a great article and want to remember it later but would promptly forget, I can now grab text and upload it directly to Obsidian or add a link with tags and text. This, alone, has sent me on a quest for greater knowledge because I know that it won’t be redundant.

## what’s a note?

Based on the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), used and developed by Niklas Luhmann, the idea is to create one note with one quote, reference or concept. I don’t always do this, for example, with my Daily Notes.

A note is a simple text file that used Markdown, an easy to use formatting methodology. The beauty of Obsidian is that these notes reside on your computer or in your cloud. The app is simply the knowledge base. The data is always yours.

Notes can be private or, if you subscribe to the Publish function, public. 

I use a minimal hierarchy but prefix notes with N (note), Q (quote), R (reference) etc. There’s also tagging i.e. hashtags that can be added to each note.

What I really love are backlinks. I use these to great effect in my Daily Notes, especially to remind me to connect with a friend or a client. By simply including [[Friend Name\|Friend Name]], this links to the note of the same name. So, I might say: Wrote letter to [[Friend Name\|Friend Name]] in my Daily Note. This will then appear as a backlink in my friend’s note. It’s a simple but very useful tool for a minimalist CRM.

The more notes you create, the more effective your system. A graph charts all the notes and how they link to each other so you have a visual representation of your Second Brain.

## the gardening analogy

Obsidian users talk a lot about digital gardens. I’ve used this concept to separate my public and private notes into my Digital Garden and my Walled Garden.

Hashtags may also include gardening references, such as seedling or evergreen to denote the status of the note. Because notes can always be evolving, they are often a work in progress until they become evergreen.

My Walled Garden is made up of a variety of folders. They reference my work, projects, business, clients. Included are my Daily Notes, note templates, Kindle highlights.

A recent project was created in Obsidian. Starting out as a compilation of ideas, quotes, and references, the various notes were indexed to outline and create the whole. Far easier than working in a single Word document, it’s freed up my headspace but given me clarity to streamline the content.

To remember a source, all I have to do is search either by terminology or hashtag. I can also pull in paragraphs from other notes by linking to text blocks.

## the daily note

I’ve always been a productivity app nerd. You name it, I’ve tried it! But what’s working for me like a dream is the Daily Note.

One of the functions of Obsidian is to automatically create a Daily Note for today. Over the last few weeks I’ve tweaked my template, adding and taking away, until it’s become functional. It is essentially a long list.

A reminder of my guiding principles. My daily Creed. My three non-negotiables for the day. And my _what have I done today_ prompt. A simple time blocking calendar reminds me to check what’s on my schedule.

At the beginning of each week and month, I check my Goals (notes, of course) and create a link in my Daily Notes template. That way I see my goals every day.

## the bells and whistles

There is an active Obsidian community on Discord and the app forum. It’s in there that I’ve learned about a variety of plugins and add ons. I’ve integrated these one at a time to give me some additional functionality such as rolling over my daily todos, a calendar, Kindle highlights. Obsidian is an app that can be extended as much or as little as you want, and it’s very easy to make it your own.

The mobile app is currently in beta but can be accessed as part of the Catalyst option.

## obsidian has lit a fire underneath me

I’ve always been a note taker. I love going down rabbits of information, and acquiring knowledge. Over the past few years, I’ve been less effective at doing this – Obsidian has opened the door again and provided me with a mechanism to gather the disparate information that interests me.

There are many Obsidian users who have written books using this app and that appeals to me. I’ve always found it difficult to focus on one thing at a time. Obsidian provides the framework to allow me to work on multiple projects, to compartmentalise those ideas yet connect them to each other too. I can download into a variety of folders without, initially, needing to make sense of it all until I reach the writing and editing stages.

I think my style of working is very much acquisition of information, first; then cultivate that information, second. Throw everything into the bucket, with suitable hashtags and links and, eventually, magic will happen and connections will be made in ways that you might never have imagined.
