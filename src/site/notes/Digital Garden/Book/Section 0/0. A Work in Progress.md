## 0. A Work in Progress

[This](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpvTI8zo_Kg/?igshid=YmRhY2Q4MGU=) by Huma Qureshi inspired me to think differently about book writing. I've tried different ways. I have a ton of notes in Obsidian. They're all fragmented and disjointed. Their volume and lack of coherence overwhelm me so they get parked and left.

So, here we are again. Starting over. 

## Obsidian

I started writing my book in Obsidian some time ago. It worked well until it didn't. Recently I've realised what the missing link has been. Instead of creating subfolders within folders I dumped in a lot of notes to the extent that I couldn't see the wood for the trees. 

I've just reorganised all my content so that it's more bite sized, and I can manage the notes much more easily.
