*I recently came across some old style websites that reminded me of the flat HTML sites I used to create back in the day, when blogging wasn't yet quite a thing and personal websites were a rabbit warren of links. It gave me the idea of making an autobiographical timeline/about page. This will be a work in progress for a while but I hope you like it!*
