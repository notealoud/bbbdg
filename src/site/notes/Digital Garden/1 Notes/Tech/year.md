## one year of obsidian

I blame Ali Abdaal. A random search about productivity started it all. Aliâ€™s YouTube video about Roam Research made me curious about this _new to me_ thing called PKM.Â 

Tech discoveries excite me with their potential. Personal Knowledge Management, Second Brain and digital gardening certainly did that. Even after 12 months, theyâ€™re still the gift that keeps on giving.

Research about Roam led me to the free option that is Obsidian. Not knowing how useful a note taking app would be, I wanted to experiment first without a huge financial outlay.

Back in late April/early May 2021, Obsidian filled my head. I would lie awake thinking of how I could use it, configure it, set it up. Iâ€™d work on my Mac until the wee small hours putting my ideas into practice.

I was an Evernote fan for years. Iâ€™d tried Bear. But they were different animals. Obsidian was at one with my first brain, making it easy for it to become my second brain.

It was the bucket into which my ideas, references, sources flowed seamlessly. Capturing these became a joy, not a hardship.

Those were the heady early days. I didnâ€™t yet know that I was building an important foundation.

## obsidian helped me become a more prolificÂ writer

What differentiated Obsidian from other tools Iâ€™d used what how easy it made seeing the links between ideas. Learning of David Perellâ€™s _writing with abundance_ approach was a lightbulb moment for me. I started importing Kindle Highlights, Matter, Readwise. I clipped paragraphs from web pages. Once in Obsidian, I added tags.

These imports often became the starting point for ideas, and inspiration for my own writing.

I like the Obsidian layout and find it conducive to creating content. Going down the rabbit hole of PKM introduced me to others who shared their setups and best practice.

The PKM community on Twitter led me to Ship 30 for 30, which opened my eyes to digital and online writing.

## obsidian evolves as IÂ do

The beauty of Obsidian is that there is no one size fits all. Iâ€™ve changed my folder structure several times. Sometimes Iâ€™ve had no folders and relied on tags. Other times, Iâ€™ve rearranged my folders. Because Obsidian is a top layer over your directory of text files, itâ€™s childâ€™s play to drag and drop files locallyâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis configuration is then replicated in Obsidian.

The main reason Iâ€™ve stuck with Obsidian is that it evolves with me.

## writingâ€Šâ€”â€Šand learningâ€Šâ€”â€ŠinÂ public

A Ship 30 for 30 concept, Obsidian lends itself to writing in public. I started out with Obsidian Publish, a paid for option that allows you to link a domain name and create a web presence. You select the notes you want to share. A lot of Obsidian users share their digital garden. I did, too, in the beginning. And then I focused on sharing my writing.

Now I use [a free publish option](https://nicolafisherwriter.substack.com/p/a-free-alternative-to-obsidian-publish?s=w). My digital garden is more expansive and the focus is on following my curiosity and [learning in public](https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/2022-use-it-or-lose-it/#/).

## text files

Derek Sivers is [a fan of text files](https://sive.rs/plaintext). I realised, somewhat belatedly, that text files have longevity. Iâ€™ve lost so many files over the years because theyâ€™ve been associated with an app, and Iâ€™ve not been able to export them. Or, even when I could export them, the file format was not easily read. Before the Obsidian iOS app went live, I used 1Writer to read and edit files on the go. Itâ€™s good not to be reliant on just one app.

## going paperless

Iâ€™m having a blitz on unnecessary paperwork. Iâ€™m scanning as much as I can and adding it to my Obsidian Vault. (Yes, in light of idea #4, scanning has its pros and cons!). While Iâ€™ll need to keep key physical documents, I want to seriously reduce our paperwork.

Iâ€™ve scanned recipes pulled from magazines over the years. Now in a baking/recipes folder and with titles like _chocolate cake (favourite)_, I hope to get round to doing more baking.

## book writing

Obsidian has been brilliant for outlining and writing the book Iâ€™m working on. I created a table of contents and then outlined the chapters. As I wrote the chapters, I backlinked the note to the table of contents. I found this really helpful in giving me greater visibility of what I was working on. Each section was a separate note, meaning I could re-order content easily. Thereâ€™s also a plugin that allows you to compile your book at the end.

## markdown

I like using Markdown. I write in Obsidian and then copy and paste into Medium. My content transfers well.

## writing workflow

Obsidian is a key element of my writing workflow. Everything starts in Napkin where I log ideas. I expand on them in NotePD. These lists can then be exported to Obsidian. I have folders containing ideas, drafts and published articles. I can also export from Obsidian to Medium.

## extendable

Obsidian can be as simple or as complex as you like. It can be extended with plugins and code. No two Obsidian setups are the same.

People often say that Obsidian is overwhelming and too complicated. But it really doesnâ€™t have to be.

Not if you think of it as a house!*](https://medium.com/talkingtech/myth-obsidian-is-too-complicated-not-if-you-think-of-it-as-a-house-d4736cd6fdf2 "https://medium.com/talkingtech/myth-obsidian-is-too-complicated-not-if-you-think-of-it-as-a-house-d4736cd6fdf2")

## repository

As well as being my writing hub, Obsidian is a repository for key information, documents, and work-related content. It can be a task manager and a to do list. You can keep daily notes, and use dataview to track specific data. I have dashboards created using the workspace plugin. I call these Mission Control!

## linking yourÂ thinking

This has been a phenomenal conference hosted by Nick Milo. Iâ€™ve been inspired by the speakers and have updated my setup in light of what Iâ€™ve learned. Iâ€™ll be sharing some of these changes in a future post.

Needless to say, Obsidian remains a key tool in my arsenal. It simply gets better and better.
