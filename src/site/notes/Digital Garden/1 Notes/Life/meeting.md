## meeting bill murray in paris

I lived in Paris in 1984/1985. Around Easter 1985, I heard that [[Digital Garden/1 Notes/Life/bill\|bill]] Murray was also living there. He'd just finished Ghostbusters (known locally as SOS Fantomes) and had been in Paris to film The Razor's Edge. I saw both of these films first in Paris.

I was 20/21 and very starstruck. I followed up every lead, to no avail. Then, one day, I was just waiting on the pavement outside the building where my next class was scheduled to take place, and he walked casually down the steps towards me. I was primed and ready and raced after him, and asked if he would sign my autograph book for me. He wrote Merry Christmas! 

The whole Hemingway and Shakespeare & Co experience rubbed off on a few of us, and I spent a lot of time jotting in notebooks. I had an idea to ask for an interview with Bill. On another occasion I spotted him (he had a very distinctive hat and walk) ambling along in front of Notre Dame, heading for the Seine. He stopped off at a bakery and I waited for him. He didn't want to do an interview, but he offered me a piece of his Palmier (which I turned down!!!) and he chatted for a while and gave me enough content for the little piece below, which is based on our conversation.

Some time later, in early May, there was a big D-Day parade on the Champs-Elysees. The place was wall to wall with people. There was no traffic and I walked, with a friend, up the road. And then, I spotted him, coming towards me. It was pretty miraculous really given how massive the crowds were. Instinctively I grabbed the arm of his leather jacket and said Hello!!

On another day, I was in the Jardins du Luxembourg walking. So was Bill. I decided to pretend I'd not seen him as it was getting too spooky by this point.

Then, one day, I was reading Paris Match and it mentioned that Bill ate regularly in a restaurant in the Marais. Of course, I went to check it out and spoke to one of the waiters. He said that Bill had left for home ... the day before! But he told me that Bill had lived in the property next door and took me to see it. Above the letterbox was a metal plaque inscribed M et Mme B Murray.

## a star is … plagued 

A student’s life in Paris is not always the easiest, especially when those mundane problems – such as where the next metro ticket will come from – crop up.  But consider the additional difficulties of the actor seeking anonymity and learning the French language in this renown city while, at the same time, seeking to avoid the ever present paparazzi. 

Recourse to an almost phantom-like existence is essential for Bill Murray in order to escape the increasing number of students who crowd into a small building near Notre Dame in an attempt to glimpse their idol in the flesh.  Initially only the more observant recognised the acclaimed film star but as the rumour spread across the grapevine more of the band of foreign students came to spectate.  “This calls for tactics”.  Several visits to Salle 9 and umpteen timetable changes later a certain amount of privacy is ensured.  Well, at least for a few days before the blood hounds pick up the scent and the poor guy is forced to change his timetable again which necessitates leaving his bed at 06:30 to be at class on time … or perhaps just forget the whole thing and play hooky for a week. 

EdF can pose great problems for any student – the plugs are such funny shapes and sizes (and where did the third pin go?).  But for the actor with TV and American stereo radio, fuses do have a tendency to blow – several times.  And the salesmen in the hi-fi shop regret that they are unable to remedy the situation. 

Fortunately the French have – partly – abandoned the little trains (such as one finds in Britain) and the TGVs provide a whole new outlook on the trip to Lyon – although the food is terrible.  The patisseries in the 5th arrondissement aren’t bad and there’s always plenty to go round. 

But how does the American (actor) student dress in Paris?  Dark glasses and “les baskets” are a must to avoid the over-enthusiastic fans … but in the words of the song “it’s a shame …” that the walk is so distinctive at least to the more avid and cinema going amongst us  For the rest, they only have to look for the slightly balding head – on days when the weather does not warrant a hat (??!! – some article of clothing perched on the golden locks).  Other accoutrements include jeans (but, of course), leather jacket or black gabardine (typically French, s’il vous plait).  Not forgetting the black “sac” flung over the back. 

However, can’t hang around here all day when there’s the library waiting or maybe even a class to go to.
