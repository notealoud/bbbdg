## gardening

I've always gardened. From being small when I used to potter about the garden with my Dad. I had a tiny patch of soil, one corner of the vegetable plot, where I would sow seeds and add small plants. Sometimes, I would dig up the plants and rearrange them! I remember diligently watering my little garden.

My Dad loved his garden. He cultivated seeds, planted plug plants, grew sweet peas, rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries and veg. The grass was always trimmed and the borders neat and weed free. In my teens he bought a greenhouse. Each Summer it would be packed with tomatoes. 

From late teens to early thirties, I did little gardening. I lived in London and had no garden of my own. My first house had a low maintenance garden. I travelled a lot for work and didn't have time to indulge in gardening. 

After my Mum died, my Dad and I bought a house together with a huge garden. It was a blank canvas. Mud everywhere. We had the foundations laid - more flagstones, raised beds, borders, a base for a greenhouse, and slate.

Along one side were trees. Fifteen altogether. Mostly hawthorn, some elder. They were ancient trees. I loved my little wood. It was my favourite part of the garden. I would scramble up the slight bank, and squeeze between branches.

My Dad and I planted hellebores, a magnolia, fuchsias, azaleas. We bought a greenhouse. For the first couple of years we did battle with weeds. The top soil was full of them! We tried everything but they were invasive. Eventually we had the top soil taken out and replaced. It helped.

We had barely scratched the surface when my Dad died and the garden became bittersweet for me. Everywhere I looked I saw his handiwork. I would sit on the edge of the raised beds, as we had often done, and see my Dad everywhere. 

Now we live in Derbyshire. Our outside space is tiny by comparison but evolving into a bijou courtyard garden. With potting shed, bench and arch, it's a place to sit and enjoy. The hellebores remind me of my Dad. A lavender cutting from a plant named Vera, like my Mum, survived three months of holiday lets in between house sale and purchase. There are rose bushes, verbena, love in a mist, poppies, and pots galore. Each one with the promise of a Summer display.

This is the first garden I've created from scratch. It's completely of my making yet all those years of gardening with my Dad are the thread that runs through it.
