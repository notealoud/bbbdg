## don't fear endings, embrace them

In my twenties, I dreaded endings and change. I preferred the status quo.

A career in the digital world, before the internet bubble burst, taught me to go with the flow. Back then, jobs often didn't last long. I moved around a lot and, as I discovered, always to something better.

I began to see that there was potential in embracing change.

## endings come in many shapes and sizes

Don't resist change. If you do, it may be forced upon you.

Pivotal moments are not just about jobs. But also bereavement, relationships, loss, or the end of a chapter.

We are programmed to fear change but we can make it work for us.

## 1. look back on your pivotal moments

These are the catalysts that have propelled you forward.

See where past losses have shaped your life now. Where did those losses lead you?

Familiarise yourself with how change feels to you. Remember that, one way or another, you've always come through.

## 2. find the silver linings

This takes time and different experiences of change.

I learned, over the years, despite the situation, that each episode of change took me down new paths. And, most importantly, let me see more clearly who I am.

## 3. don't fear change

Change is inevitable. The more you can be open to the changes presenting themselves, the easier you make the process on yourself.

Welcome change with open arms. It will make all the difference.

Understanding this roadmap has helped me navigate loss more easily. Simply because I know that there is always light at the end of the tunnel.
