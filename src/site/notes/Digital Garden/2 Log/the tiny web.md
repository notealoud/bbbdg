## the tiny web

I'm intrigued by the tiny web. Bob Doto mentioned the term. To me it speaks of simple websites, possibly text based. 

It makes me think back to the early days of the public web. When I hand coded HTML and created simple sites. When links were the thing and every website was another tunnel down the rabbit hole. I loved those days.

Obsidian and similar tools lend themselves to this idea of the tiny web. And I think that's why I love them so much.

There's something very liberating in focusing on the content rather than the design. I'm cogitating on the possibilities of reducing my multiple websites down to just one, and which platform I use for that.

Whichever way I go, the content will be driven by Obsidian.
