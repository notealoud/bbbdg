## why I'm no longer a bridge burner

> May the bridges I burn light the way ~ Dylan McKay, Beverly Hills 90210

I'm a long time bridge burner. An advocate of letting go and decluttering, bridge burning has always fitted right into my philosophy.

The urge to, metaphorically, strike a match and burn everything to the ground creeps up on me. In the past, that's what I've done. Websites, notebooks, projects, writing have all gone up in flames. And it feels so good!

And while the bridge burning does shine a light on matters, there is no going back. Later I have to start bridge building, recreating a different version of what existed before.

The urge to put a fire under everything has been strong again. But, I’m rethinking my strategy.

The bridges that I’ve burned come back to haunt me, to nudge me and tell me that my work is not yet done. There are still new avenues to explore.

So, I’m concentrating on what fires me up, what sets me alight, and use that to light my way instead.
