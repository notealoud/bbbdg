# tallulah

Tallulah was ill over the weekend. On Saturday she was spending a lot of time at the bottom of her bowl. On Sunday she was occasionally turning somersaults. On Sunday night I put her in quarantine in the washing up bowl (reserved for Tallulah). She seemed a bit better and I was hopeful of recovery by the next morning. Today I dashed downstairs to check on her and she was rolling over and over, and her back had that tell tale bend in it. I thought that was it. I didn't want to go to work and leave her like that all day and decided the kindest thing would be to put her out of her misery. Of course that was easier said than done. You're supposed to use a plastic bag and let all the air out. It took me ages to get my act together and involved a phone call to my Dad for advice. With him on the other end of the phone I lowered the bag into the water and let it fill. Then Tallulah rolled and rolled into it. I started letting the water out and Tallulah fell out too. And then suddenly she started swimming perfectly normally. I have no idea what happened, whether being in the bag made a difference or gave her a shock, but something made her completely normal again. I watched her for a while and she was fine. To be on the safe side, and in case desperate measures were required, my Dad came over during the day to check she was still OK. He had strict instructions that, should a funeral be necessary, it was to be a burial not a flushing down the loo.

I got a call mid morning to say that the patient was making good progress and was still swimming around quite merrily. Phew.

Tonight I came home and checked the washing up bowl. Still swimming around happily. So I transferred Tallulah back into her bowl and she's making herself at home again. She seems slightly more nutty than before but she has had a near death experience so it's to be expected.

I did some research on the web and her symptoms are typical of constipation or swim bladder problems. I've had goldfish with these symptoms in the past and it's always ended badly. But there are cures and I inadvertently found one. Another is peas.
