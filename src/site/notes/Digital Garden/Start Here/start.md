“The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard. There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed. Most people die with everything still inside of them. The way to live is to create. Die empty. Get every idea out of your head and into reality. Calling yourself creative doesn’t make it true. Make finishing your top priority.” ~ Derek Sivers, How to Live

## welcome to my digital garden

I'm Nicola, and I'm most at home with tech, spending time with cows and being out in nature. I'm a writer, podcaster and photographer. I live in a small village in the Peak Park area of Derbyshire with my husband, [Chris](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk), and his Guide Dog, Bamber. By day, I work a busy job, by night I tinker with tech, PKM and writing. This digital garden is currently my sole web(site) presence.
