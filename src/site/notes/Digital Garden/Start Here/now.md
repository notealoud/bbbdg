## what I'm doing now ...

> “The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard. There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed. Most people die with everything still inside of them. The way to live is to create. Die empty. Get every idea out of your head and into reality. Calling yourself creative doesn’t make it true. Make finishing your top priority.”

## the ephemeral lollipop

In the past week or so I've been clearing out a lot of old stuff, websites that were going nowhere and creative projects that had stalled. I've always been one for burning bridges. I don't believe in going back. Forward motion is what's required. 

The razing to the ground has helped. I didn't expect it to. I thought I was just going to stand facing a brick wall until I could find a way around it.

I've started diving back into Obsidian. All my notes were in there (or here as that's where I write my Now page). My book which I'd abandoned and given up on has been revived. I'm regrouping. I've pulled the pages out of the metaphorical drawer and found there is some hope. As well as a new perspective that's developed over the intervening months. All is not lost after all.

Perhaps this is simply the nature of creating.

I'm thinking a lot about minimalism. Having less. Decluttering. Letting go. It always works for me. Making space. I'm pondering how I can create a sustainable, minimal online presence where I can be present.

## this is what I did

Substack: I really like this platform but it's not working for me at all right now. So, I've razed it to the ground. I'm not sure yet what purpose this will fulfil. Looking out for Notes to land on my account. I see potential for these. I'm turned off by the whole hustle culture and personal brand. I tried that and it didn't work for me. I'm thinking blogging and quirkiness.

Medium: I make a small monthly income despite not writing anything much at all. It covers my monthly subscription and buys me a coffee or two. I'm revisiting old draft ideas and plan to post these on Medium. Medium will probably be my tech writing outlet.

Podcasts: all deleted. I'm rehoming them on Obsidian. I love audio and am pondering how I can continue to podcast. Possibly through Substack.

## Obsidian

I've been spending a lot of time lately honing my Obsidian Vault. I've restructured it along the lines of PARA, which has helped massively. (I've also set up my email and file structure in the same way). I'm using a new to me plugin, Projects, to create a content plan. Writing, here we come! 

I've created project plans which has given me greater clarity about all the plates I'm currently spinning. This week has been a bit easier, although busy, and I feel as if I've moved forward.

I've streamlined all my to do lists and used Dataview to create monthly and yearly lists.

## writing

Even though I have little time, getting back into Obsidian has helped me rediscover my mojo. As I mentioned here previously, knowing that what I write doesn't have to be perfect (digital garden philosophy) has made things easier.

## book

I always hesitate to write about *my book* for fear of jinxing it. This book has been in the works for a long time! Each time I've abandoned it in despair, believing that I was done with it, I've been proved wrong. Now, thanks to the miracles of Obsidian, I've moved all my book notes into one folder. It's a mess. There is a lot that needs to be rewritten and more than needs to be organised. I'm not sure how I'm going to do it yet. I suspect it might involve Post-Its.

I'm pondering ways of managing and structuring my book. Not sure yet whether Projects will lend itself to this. I think I need some sort of grid where I can lay out the content.

## work

Still very busy and lots to do but the 12 month plan is being implemented, two new staff have joined which is helping. I've taken on a new project so am at full capacity. We have started to make visible progress. Things are starting to come together.

I realised the other day, driving home from work, that although I like what I do it doesn't give me a creative buzz. I've felt tired for months, partly from doing so much but also, I think, from doing too little of what lights me up. Just getting back into fiddling with Obsidian has brought me back to life again.

## personal

I've allowed myself to be taken over by demands and responsibilities, and found myself in a rut. I've taken a line of least resistance. It's been easier just to go with the flow. I've been exhausted and not had the energy to do anything about it. Now that Spring is here, the mornings are lighter earlier, it's as though I've had a boost of energy. I know it requires discipline to carve out time for myself despite how hard that seems to be. 

I want to see my cows, walk a lot more, potter in the garden. I'm going to adopt a work to rule approach. No more late nights, no more weekend working. Let's see how that pans out! I took on this work because it was part time and would enable me to fit in other stuff but it's been so all consuming and overwhelming, it's not worked out that way.

## twos

Still loving [Twos](https://www.TwosApp.com?code=nicola). It's an incredible to do list app, reminder app, note taking app and list app. I like the mix. The lists manage my projects and keep me on track. Twos World let's me share public lists and see other people's lists. It's a brilliant tool. 

On a weekly basis I find more ways to use Twos. I create new lists and add content all the time. It really does help me get more done.
