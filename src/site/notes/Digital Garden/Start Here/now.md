> “The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard. There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed. Most people die with everything still inside of them. The way to live is to create. Die empty. Get every idea out of your head and into reality. Calling yourself creative doesn’t make it true. Make finishing your top priority.”

## Twos, Tana, Obsidian - the triumvirate

Tana remains one of the tools in my collection. I love the way I can add content and resurface notes. I'm using Tana as my writing hub. It lends itself to the development and tracking of ideas. It's very customisable, which I love, and I now have a Today page that works for me.

Although you can track tasks in Tana, it doesn't push them out to me in the same way that my beloved Twos does. I like the way Twos nudges me to complete tasks, sends reminders and moves incomplete items to the following day. 

I've been streamlining my project plan in Twos and simplifying my process. It has given me additional clarity. This month Twos launched on Product Hunt and made it to Number 1. My current favourite feature is the ability to publish *things*. This is creating a Twos social media network which is lovely.

Obsidian is where I write. Ideas developed in Tana are copied into Obsidian when I'm ready to write.

## where I'm writing

Quick answer: I'm not. So much. 

I have posted a few articles on Medium - one was picked up by Tiago Forte and saw a nice spike in views. Another has gained some traction. 

I've fallen out of love with Substack although I still have an account there. I just can't make it fit in my plan right now. 

I'm mostly on Twitter because there's a lot of chat about Tana, PKM and Twos.

## work

Work has been overwhelming and relentless in terms of projects on my plate. I spend a lot of my time at my laptop on calls, doing admin, managing. I think I prefer the *doing* rather than the *managing*. Definitely lost my mojo and been trying to find it elsewhere.

## smallholding

We're currently looking for a patch of land or smallholding where we can start with some hens. 

I'm going on a one day smallholding for beginners course to get an overview. I have three Haynes manuals too - sheep, hens, smallholding.

## twos

Still loving [Twos](https://www.TwosApp.com?code=nicola). It's an incredible to do list app, reminder app, note taking app and list app. I like the mix. The lists manage my projects and keep me on track. Twos World let's me share public lists and see other people's lists. It's a brilliant tool. 

On a weekly basis I find more ways to use Twos. I create new lists and add content all the time. It really does help me get more done.
