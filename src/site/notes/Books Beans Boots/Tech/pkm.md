## 🌱 why personal knowledge management is a game changer

Ever since I first came across Obsidian earlier this year, my life has changed.

I quickly became obsessed with Obsidian, with its notetaking ability, and how I could transform a vanilla app into something bespoke. The extraordinary community around Obsidian introduced me to a range of practices, processes and plugins which enhanced my experience.

And down the rabbit hole, I went!

Along the way I found others, like David Perell, who shared the concept of writing from abundance. By funnelling content from other sources such as the web, Readwise, Kindle highlights, tweets and Matter into Obsidian, I began to create my own repository of ideas and inspiration. Stepping stones away from the terror of the blank page!

It was Martine Ellis' workflow that shone a light on my own. Mine is not yet perfect but I now have a logical structure to become, as David Perell says, a producer or creator as opposed to simply a consumer.

This structure gives me a weekly plan, accountability and the momentum to keep on creating.

The whole PKM journey has reignited my love of discovery. Not only am I writing more, but I'm reading more widely and leap frogging from idea to idea. It has been a game changer in so many ways.

It's introduced me to a whole new world of apps, to people I might otherwise never have spoken to, and brought me an incredible sense of fulfilment. It's become a way of life.
