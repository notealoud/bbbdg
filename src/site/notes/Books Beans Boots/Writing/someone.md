## don't try to be like someone else

> “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.” Oscar Wilde

It's easy to look at what others are doing and think that it would be a great idea to do the same. I admire people who have succeeded in their field, especially the one I want to be in, and wonder whether I could achieve similar success.

I ask myself: _What can I learn from them? How could I emulate what they do?_

But they're not me. And my circumstances are uniquely mine.

Admiring another can hold us back. Instead of looking inward, relying on ourself as the source of our ideas, we look outside.

## the teacher will disappear

In his woodturning work, Chris adopted the mantra, _learn, break away, transcend_. It originates from the concept of [Shu-Ha-Ri](https://betterhumans.pub/10-japanese-concepts-for-self-improvement-and-a-balanced-life-42cf0be2da1a): _follow, break away, transcend_.

-   You first learn from someone else or follow another's teaching.
-   Then you apply what you've learned to your own work.
-   Finally you use your learnings, but add your own unique take.

> When the student is ready the teacher will appear. When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear.”

> Tao Te Ching

We can't travel on parallel paths. Sooner or later, we have to part ways and each do our own thing.

## self-doubt

We're all different and I'm especially quirky. Yet even now, at 58, I know there are times when I'm still not fully owning who I really am.

I often feel a sense of lack, of not being good enough, not being right enough. I look at others and believe they are more _right_ than me.

> When we hear this voice in our head that says "you're not good enough," "it's all been done," et cetera, et cetera, what makes that so powerful against us is we think it's our own thoughts. We think, "Oh, that's me assessing the situation objectively." But it's not! It's this other siren voice, this force that's just out there, that's a fact of nature and once we can say, "Oh, that's not me," that kind of is the key to the whole thing.

## being alright

But I am alright as I am.

I first learned this in my twenties when I attended a workshop in London. We had to find a word to follow _I am ..._ which described us. I remember starting with _I am wrong_. It took me half a day to get to _I am alright_.

> I think I’m addicted to periods of doubt and low confidence. I think you should worry if you don’t have them because then you’re not trying hard enough. If you’re sure that everything you’re going to do is going to be good, then what’s the point? I used to think of it as just crippling self-doubt. Now I kind of see it as a sign that I’m teetering on the edge of something new. Or troubling.

Finding your voice in writing and in any other context is about being yourself. It's about finding your truth. It comes back, again, to reconnecting with your essence, your genius, your spark. Everything comes back to the same place. Whatever it is we're doing, to succeed at it, we need to live our truth.

## on the edge

Be who you really are, not a figment of your imagination. We need to be our glorious selves not a facsimile.

We water ourselves down, we focus on the inconsequential stuff. We don't go all in or put our heart and soul into it.

> You gotta commit. You've gotta go out there and improvise and you've gotta be completely unafraid to die. You've got to be able to take a chance to die. And you have to die lots. You have to die all the time.
> 
> Bill Murray

## how far have you come?

Look back over the past 5 or 10 years. How much has changed for you?

-   7 years ago I was happily single and envisaged staying that way indefinitely
-   3 years ago I was a full time business advisor hustling and crushing it
-   2 years ago I lived in a busy town

Then, fast forward.

We now live in the Derbyshire Dales, a beautiful and rural part of the country, in a small village, surrounded by fields, cows and sheep.

Perhaps this was my break away. Moving somewhere very different, and building a life uniquely of my own making. Maybe that’s how we transcend.
