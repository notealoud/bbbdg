## 🌿 ellen

10 June 1982 - Thursday

Miss Piggy's was groaning at the seams, as usual. The clientele was predominately on the large side. Their clothes stretching at the seams. The food was heart attack inducing, which suited cusomers whose tastes tended toward the gluttonous, the fat and greasy. These were people who loved food in all its forms. They lived to eat. 

Yet, Miss Piggy's wasn't your classic greasy spoon. It had become an upmarket version with all the greasy spoon essentials for the discerning. 

Miss Piggy's specialised in everything pork. From double decker breakfast bacon barms to rustic racks of pork ribs. 

Everyone agreed, the food was to die for.

Ellen was Miss Piggy. Rotund with tiny black piggy eyes, and shiny pink skin. She became known as Miss Piggy in kindergarten. Always eating, always plump, she never lost this soubriquet.

Naming her restaurant was a no brainer.

Her passion for eating grew as she realised, in her teens, that she could make food her career. She trained as a chef. Every day she tasted food, sometimes in greater quantities than necessary. She was in heaven.

While she loved all food, pork was her favourite. 

By the time Ellen established Miss Piggy's she was in her mid thirties. Now she was not only fat but also loud. With a wobbling double chin, and stomach expanding beneath the confines of her clothes, she was an intimidating sight.

Over the years, as the success of her restaurant grew, so did her belligerence. Staff rarely stayed longer than three months but somehow she recruited more, and her reputation flourished.

Miss Piggy's had expanded over the years and now occupied a prime spot in town. She attracted regular and passing trade throughout the day. 

She created the annual Pork Fest, the most successful local event. The farmers loved her. She kept them in business. And who doesn't like a bacon barm? 

Ellen was a grafter. Up early and still there when the last member of staff had gone home, she was a beast.

Ellen liked the quiet after the last shift of the day. She enjoyed having the restaurant to herself. Every night she cooked several rashers of bacon, adding her signature sauce to the pan. She sliced two doorsteps of bread, liberally buttered them with the best local butter.

In the kitchen, she reached for the tomato ketchup. Even after all these years, there was nothing better. Then she took her plate to her favourite table and sat down to eat.

As she gazed around her restaurant she admired the tasteful decor, some of it featuring pigs.

She took a huge bite of her bacon sandwich. Like a drug, she relaxed as she tasted that familiar taste. 

She took another bite. The bacon caught in her throat. Her mouth was on fire like never before. She choked and tried to cough but her mouth felt numb. 

Panicked, she stood up, pushing back her chair. Trying to catch her breath, the huge mouthful of bacon was wedged. She tried again and again.

Finally, she fell to the floor, already knowing that her life was ebbing away. Unable to do anything, unable to call for help even if there was anyone to hear.  As she lay there, her eyes gazed at a clock. Two pigs, one on the end of each hand, progress around the clock. She stopped breathing.

In the kitchen, a gloved hand removed the ketchup bottle and replaced it with another, labelled Special Sauce. The back door opened as someone exited the building.

It was the Monday morning when the first staff arrived. Bustling about, getting ready, prepping the food, it was almost an hour before someone entered the dining room and spotted Ellen lying on the floor.

By now rigor mortis had set in. She'd been dead for almost 36 hours.

The police were called. 

A week later Ellen's deputy started wading through the stack of post on Ellen's desk. She might have been a good chef but admin wasn't her forté. Among the mail, was a death certificate notification.

Ellen 
Age: 54
Cause of death: accidental, choking

"You didn't see that one coming", he said out loud, to no-one in particular.
