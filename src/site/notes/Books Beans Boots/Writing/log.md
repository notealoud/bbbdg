## 🌱 why you need to keep a daily log

Keeping a daily log is a relatively new thing for me. It started after I came across [Michael Dean](https://www.michaeldean.site/)’s website.

Virginia Woolf kept a shipping log.
Hemingway? What did he do?
Miranda Keeling book.

It’s great for my writing. I’m a people watcher and make up backstories for complete strangers. Those stories can later become characters in fiction.

It helps me remember moments that otherwise would be forgotten.

It makes me notice more and keep a record.

I use Napkin to record these thoughts. I can then either tag them and add them to the general mix. Or I can deliberately add them to a Stack to form part of an article I’m writing or for future inspiration.

Napkin has changed my tracking so much. I can quickly and easily record something I heard. The other day Chris said: _Bamber can spot a crumb on a fly’s leg._ I would never have remembered that if I hadn’t added it to Napkin.

This was a really good meal I ate in the Cotswolds: _Pan fried chicken breast. Crushed new potatoes. Roasted root veg. Tarragon jus. Coriander?_ Just re-reading that reminds me of the wonderful flavours of this dish. It’s like a verbal photograph.

Another observation about Bamber: _What’s a moveable feast? It’s moving food out of Bamber’s way!_

Here’s a description of someone we met. I may use him as a character. _G gave us £5 for Guide Dogs. Glasses. Grey neck length hair. Light brown leather waistcoat. Talked to himself. Took a shine to Bamber. Despite being blotto, remembered his name._
