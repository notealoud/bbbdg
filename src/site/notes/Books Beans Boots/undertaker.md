## the undertaker

The fireman squeezed his body into the firebox. It was a tight fit but he was skinny and he slid himself through the narrow opening. He needed to get on with his preparations.

He had already thrown in the old wood to line the bottom of the firebox. Next he needed to douse it with fuel. There was no room for error.

Once everything was ready, he inched his way out again, back into the cab.

It was dark, just gone midnight. The shed was empty. There were no other engines to be lit tonight. Their crews were away or had gone home. It was now or never.

His car was parked close to the engine. He walked along the path, now pitch black, and opened up the boot. Earlier he had disconnected the CCTV. Power cuts were a regular occurrence at the railway - a gap in the footage wouldn’t attract any attention. He heaved the body over his shoulder, carried it back to the engine and lifted it into the cab.

The body was wrapped in dark cloth and taped up. The figure inside was, fortunately, small.

He needed to move fast as the fire had to be red hot well before morning.

He balanced a plank in the opening to the firebox and rested the body on top of it. Then he pushed hard and the plank and the body dropped into place.

Next he threw in liberal quantities of sulphur before starting to rhythmically shovel the coal until the body was concealed.

Even if anyone should look now, they would see nothing. He climbed down from the cab and started making his checks. He took his time. He was known for his efficiency and diligence. It wouldn’t do to break the habit of a lifetime. This was why the job of keeping the fire lit in the engine throughout the night fell to him.

Once the checks were made, he wrapped an old rag soaked in petrol around a stick, lit it and threw it into the firebox. He aimed for the front first. Then he repeated the process with three other sticks wrapped in rags. The wood in the firebox caught and the fire began to take hold. Within the hour, the coal was burning and starting to glow.

He closed the firebox door.

His main concern had been the smell of burning flesh. He hoped the sulphur dioxide would conceal it and that traces of the body would be gone by morning. He was safe until around 7 a.m. when the first of the other engineers would arrive.

Within a couple of hours the heat in the firebox was around 1000 degrees. Normally he wouldn’t fire the engine so much but tonight was an exception. It would need to cool a little before morning.

Towards dawn he shovelled on more coal, banking the fire so that it didn’t go out but would be ready for when the engine was away at 9 o’clock. It was a fine balancing act.

He cleaned his shovel and threw three rashers of bacon on to it, resting it in the firebox.

Malcolm arrived first.

‘Morning, Adam, he said. ‘How are we doing?’.

‘Great, the fire’s just about right. Fancy a bacon butty?’.

‘Is that what I can smell? Pretty potent pig that one!’.

Adam suppressed a wry smile.

It was a Saturday morning. Tourists and weekend steam enthusiasts descended on to the station. The tourists headed straight for the cafe to fill up on tea and toast, while the train fans teetered precariously along the edge of the platform, craning their necks, each wanting to be the first to see the engine come into view.

Children ran around the outside of the buildings as parents sipped the instant coffee from paper cups.

Back at the shed the engine was almost ready to leave. Adam looked at his pocket watch.

Malcolm nodded. ‘Time we were off’, he said.

Engineers milled about below, some paying no attention and others watching intently as the engine moved slowly forward.

‘Where’s that coal from?’, asked one of them, ‘it stinks to high heaven’.

As the engine rounded the corner Adam saw the crowds of people waiting to board. He recognised some of the regulars, the anoraks as they were known. Many knew him and shouted hello as the train sailed past to the furthest end of the platform. He raised his gloved hand in greeting.

The passengers boarded the train. Several of the anoraks didn’t bother to find a seat. They would stand near the doors once the train started moving with their heads hanging out of the window. Some came prepared with goggles to stop the soot getting in their eyes.

Children bounced on seats, keen to be moving and thrilled to be riding behind a steam engine.

The ancient guard looked up and down the platform, checking that all travelling passengers were aboard. He closed a couple of open doors, checked the time on the clock and then waved his green flag, blew his whistle and stepped nimbly on to the train.

Adam watched from the footplate, waiting for the signal.

‘Right away’.

Malcolm, an old timer, dressed in the traditional uniform of the steam engine driver, dark blue boiler suit, black donkey jacket and obligatory cap, squeezed the release handle, blew the whistle a couple of times and let off the brakes. Opening the throttle, he looked out of the cab window and shouted down to the platform staff,

‘Back in an hour’, as the train gently moved forward.

For November, it was a mild sunny day. Perfect train weather. Normally Adam loved these days. The heat from the firebox kept everyone warm. They were dry which was a vast improvement on the driving rain soaking them through the back of the open cab. It was a good crew and Malcolm, one of the experienced drivers, was always up for a laugh or regaling them with stories of driving on the mainline.

Today Adam was on edge. Even though everything was going to plan, he wouldn’t relax until the engine was back on shed that night and the firebox cleaned out.

He didn’t know if he had become accustomed to the smell or simply couldn’t detect it now. The body was well and truly burned. As he shovelled coal into the firebox, he couldn’t see anything that would be deemed out of place. The whole of the inside of the firebox glowed red hot.

After a circuit of the twelve miles of preserved railway, they arrived back at their starting point. The lunchtime relief crew was waiting. They climbed into the cab, exchanging banter with the others.

Adam updated them on how the engine was running.

‘Just keep an eye on the water and top up the coal on the fire. You’re good to go’.

They knew Adam was a man of few words. He chatted a little more to the likes of Malcolm but he had a reputation for being rather inscrutable.

No-one had any idea that Adam felt like he was holding his breath for the entire hour before the relief returned. He ate his fruit and bread without enjoying it, casually watching the minutes before he could head back to the platform.

He exhaled as the train came into view. Passengers milled around on the platform as Adam climbed up the ladder into the cab.

‘Everything alright, boys?’, he asked, glancing at the pressure gauge.

‘Fine, Adam, no problem’, said the relief fireman.

Adam knew that the fireman wasn’t up to the job, as he opened the valve to top up the water. Today that was in his favour. He opened the firebox door and looked in. The fire needed building up but there was nothing untoward to be seen.

Malcolm returned more leisurely. As the day progressed, despite the best of intentions, the timetable started to slip. They would be late leaving the station. Malcolm poured tea into his enamel mug, sat down on the driver’s seat and prepared to wait a while.

‘That relief crew needs some training. Any longer and we would have been in trouble - the water pressure was way down’.

Malcolm smiled. Adam was keen and known as a stickler for doing everything by the book.

‘You say that every week. Not everyone is a natural like you’.

Adam grunted and turned away to check the many gauges and levels, and at the same time mentally ticking off another item on his checklist. It was all about consistency. There was a predictability to these days. Everyone had a part to play.

The afternoon passengers came and went. The train made multiple circuits of the track until they reached their final destination.

‘Do you need me tonight?’, asked the young cleaner, barely concealing his hope for an early finish so that he could get home, showered and ready for his date with Lucy, his girlfriend.

‘Not much to do, need you tomorrow though’.

‘No worries, see you in the morning’.

Adam had hoped Nick would want to rush off to be with his girlfriend. Tonight it suited him just fine.

Adam was an unlikely henchman to the mob. He was quiet and kept himself to himself. Most of the other railway volunteers had no idea where he lived or what he did during the week.

It had all begun years before.

Adam, a typical loner, had joined the TA, spending weekend after weekend on exercises, touring in Germany and eventually being selected to train with the SAS. Later, he signed up as part of an off the books, paid fighting force. Men who were expendable, relatively cheap but who relished the opportunity to be something of an action man.

He loved going to Hereford for final training because he could pass, for a short time, as one of the elite. As anyone had the potential to be an officer, the rank and file saluted him. On one occasion he even shook hands with royalty!

He was shipped off to Afghanistan. Knowing no-one would believe him to be on holiday he had made up a story about needing treatment for a vague condition. He didn’t know when he would return to the railway. While he was in Afghanistan a number of his team were killed. One was trapped by the Taliban between a car and a wall, killed and almost cut in two. Adam spent two weeks in the hospital, lucky to escape with only a knife wound to his side. As he lay there, he mentally totted up his bank balance. It had been a good earner.

Back home he attended the funerals of his dead colleagues. The grieving widow of his closest friend sobbed on his shoulder.

It was after the funeral that he shared a drink with Mick, at least that’s what he said he was called. Still reeling from the deaths in the team, his side aching and with a sense of having been let down, Adam was primed and ready for a new career.

It was all very slowly slowly catchy monkey. Mick alluded to good money, flashed the cash, made sure his Omega watch was visible, and drove a top of the range Land Rover. His gift was drawing in new recruits. He knew when to push and when to bide his time. He could see that Adam was going to be a slow burn so he was prepared to play the long game.

It was a couple of months later that Adam eventually received a call from Mick.

‘I’m going to be in your neck of the woods this week. Fancy a pint?’.

Of course, Mick had no such plans. He needed to move things on. His bosses were becoming impatient. Adam was a prime catch with his unique set of skills.

‘I can do Tuesday. Will be great to see you’.

The following week they met at the Phone Box. It was a cool and popular spot. Trendy, upmarket. It was also a bit quirky as you had to know where it was to find it. Perfect for a man who fancied himself as a bit of a spy, Adam would appreciate the challenge.

Mick booked a table - easily done as this was also one of the mob’s watering holes.

‘How’s the war wound?’, he asked Adam when they were both seated at their table.

‘Just a bit of a dull ache now’.

‘Are you going back to Afghanistan?’.

‘No, I don’t think so. I’ve been more or less invalided out, more’s the pity. It’s going to take months to get back to full fitness’.

‘What are you going to do with yourself?.

‘I’ll be back on the railway next weekend’.

‘How would you feel about some more work?’.

Mick then explained what he needed.

---

Back home and with his ego well and truly stroked, Adam contemplated Mick’s offer.

It was an unusual request but possible. It amused him that he would be going from working for one mob to a different type of mob. But that didn’t worry him. He welcomed the thrill that distracted him from his otherwise pedestrian life.

Adam had asked Mick if he could think about it but in truth he had already worked out the logistics before he got back home.

He dialled a number on the mobile that Mick had handed him.

‘Aye, aye’, said Adam. ‘Yes, I’ll do it’.

‘Terrific, we’ll be in touch’.

---

The mob had been part of Mick’s life since childhood. His Dad had worked for them keeping their cars and lorries serviced and repaired, no questions asked. He had often worked overnight to bash out dents and repair scratches.  In his teens Mick would give his Dad a hand and he knew many of the men by sight. It was only a matter of time before he was inducted into the mob. And then there was no going back.

He started out working with his Dad on the cars but it soon became clear that he had a knack for making connections and he had the gift of the gab. He was transferred to a rather bleak building. On the outside it looked dilapidated and unused but, inside, no expense was spared.

Discretion was the key word. The mob had used this building for over 50 years and anyone caught being indiscreet wasn’t indiscreet for long! There were rules about the comings and goings.

As with everyone in the organisation, Mick had to work his way up. There was a hierarchy and information was on a need to know basis. It was many years before Mick caught a glimpse of Q.

It had been something of a shock to discover that Q was a woman. Her identity and even her sex was fiercely guarded.

She was a petite woman. Seen out of context, perhaps in a restaurant or hotel, she wouldn’t elicit a second glance. She was deliberately low key in her dress and appearance. But a closer look revealed that everything she wore was bespoke. Her jewellery was minimal but very expensive. She was cultured and could converse with anyone about almost anything. She had an eidetic memory.

Q was considered something of an enigma. Her route to the top lay strewn with many dead bodies.

Back at the shed, Adam reflected that it had been an easy way to make some money.

He went into the volunteers’ cabin and made himself a cup of tea. He didn’t normally drink tea but he needed to look busy for a while until the others had left for home.

The drivers and other crew came in, some getting a brew before they finished for the day, others chatting about some incident or other with a passenger.

Finally, the last one left.

Adam poured away his tea, rinsed his mug and went back to the engine.

Unusually for a Saturday he would have to empty the firebox, and then light the fire all over again for the following day. Cleaning the firebox was generally reserved for Sundays when the weekend runs were over.

He needed to clear out any lingering fragments of bones. Mick had been very specific about asking for these as proof that the job had been done.

There wasn’t much left but Adam picked out the last human remains, wrapping them in newspaper. They were still warm.

Mick had arranged to meet that night at an anonymous little pub. It was busy enough for them not to be remarked upon. They sat in the snug. Nearby, regulars, old men with yellow nicotine stained fingers, drank local beer.

As agreed, both men casually dropped their bags on the floor.

They ordered pints. Adam regaled Mick with tales from the railway. An hour later, they each picked up a bag and left.

Adam’s bag was now full of used notes, his payment for a job well done.

---

It was almost a month later when Adam switched on the television to watch the news headlines.

The second story was about a house that had been set on fire. Arson was suspected. Adam didn’t register the story until the newsreader said that charred remains had been discovered but police investigators were puzzled as body parts appeared to be missing. The house belonged to a known female mob boss. The arson had been attributed to a rival gangland family who denied the claims.

---

Further stories about the fire appeared in newspapers over the following days. The final article indicated that police had still not been able to fathom what had happened.

Adam put down the newspaper and grinned.

The phone rang. It was Mick.
