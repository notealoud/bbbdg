## 🌿 life

In 1984/85, I lived in Paris and studied at the Sorbonne. One of my enduring memories is [[Books Beans Boots/Life/meeting|meeting]] [[Books Beans Boots/Life/bill|Bill]] Murray. Ghostbusters was just out - I saw it in English with French subtitles - and Bill had recently filmed The [[Books Beans Boots/Life/razor|Razor]]'s Edge, which I watched in a cinema on the Champs Elysées.

These days, I write a lot about [[Books Beans Boots/Life/endings|endings]] and new [[Books Beans Boots/Life/beginnings|beginnings]], and the [[Books Beans Boots/Life/steps|steps]] you can take to live life at a gentler pace, and this [[Books Beans Boots/Life/pivotal|pivotal]] moment that we're all living through.

I share memories of places I've visited including a long time favourite, [[Books Beans Boots/Life/chesters|Chesters]].

Inspired by a photographer I know, I started to create my own [[Books Beans Boots/Life/credo|credo]].

Now I live in Derbyshire with my husband who is [[Books Beans Boots/Life/blind|blind]] and his guide [[Books Beans Boots/Life/dog|dog]]. We got [[Books Beans Boots/Life/married|married]] in Hoghton Tower where James I knighted the loin of beef. Chris doesn't want his [[Books Beans Boots/Life/sight|sight]] [[Books Beans Boots/Life/back|back]]. I write about disability and how to talk to a blind [[Books Beans Boots/Life/man|man]].

I love [[Books Beans Boots/Life/gardening|gardening]] too. And [[Books Beans Boots/Life/mugs|mugs]]!
