## if you lost your sight, would you want it back?

My husband lives in the dark. It pulls at my heartstrings the most on nights when he's sitting in a room with no lights on. 

Completely blind for the past 13 years, my husband doesn't want his sight back. To most people this is unfathomable. What is life without seeing?

I've learned, in the world of the blind, there are two types of people. The visually impaired and the sighted. For those of us who can see, that is our normal. That's our baseline. For someone who is blind, that's also their normal.

When we're out and about, it's clear that, despite the rather large German Shepherd Guide Dog, most people don't correlate being blind with being unable to see. We know that because many people try to walk through Chris, expecting him to see them and move out of the way. 

By the same token, they don't make the leap from their normal to Chris' normal. You don't want your sight back?! Why?

It took four years of walking through fire for Chris to come out the other side. Four years of anxiety so bad that Chris contemplated suicide. He had daily hallucinations, muscle spasms, nausea, and was afraid to go out. Eventually, he came to terms with his sight loss and moved forward with his life.

Losing your sight is not just an overnight transition. So, it's quite possible that regaining your sight could be a similar experience in reverse.

Mostly though, Chris is happy with who he is. A blind man.
