## don't put the blind man in the corner

How do you talk to a blind man or woman? The same way you talk to anyone.

Chris and I went to a networking event. We had Bamber with us, of course. The room was packed so we stood near the door. It was impossible to circulate. No-one came over. I can only imagine the reasons why.

We never went to that event again.

## don't judge by appearances

Like many blind or visually impaired people, Chris has an extraordinary story to tell.

-   It's only his eyes that don't work.

-   Being blind is not contagious.

-   Don't be afraid of making a faux pas. Don't walk on eggshells. Just be you.

-   You don't need to change your language. I still say, _look at this_ as shorthand for come over here and feel this.

Here are some things you can do.

## step 1: talk to the blind man, not just the dog

People come up to us - to talk to Bamber. Often they don't even acknowledge Chris.

(It's good practice to ask the Guide Dog owner first before approaching their dog).

Chris only has Bamber because he's blind. Why not talk to Chris too.

## step 2: don't ignore the blind man

People sometimes think if they don't speak, Chris won't know they're there. He knows!

While Chris is very gung ho, it's easy for him to be isolated. All he needs is an _in_, to be included.

## step 3: just be kind

The best approach is, be nice, be kind. Treat everyone the way you wish to be treated, not just the blind or visually impaired. You won't go far wrong.
